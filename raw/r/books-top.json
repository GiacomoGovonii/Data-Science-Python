She has struggled with all three of anorexia, binge eating, and bulimia, and she details her experience (including how she felt when doing it). Her book is great to spread awareness on what those with eating disorders go through, especially those who binge and purge, as she even writes about the toll it takes on her body. About her anorexia, she includes details about calorie intake and things like that. But of course, as with most good things, there are cons to it too. Although, if informed, a person who might get triggered could avoid the situation by not reading it. Someone actually wrote a post on r/bulimia to warn people that he relapsed from reading it. Another person commented that they too relapsed for the same reason. If the two of them did, I'm sure many many people around the world have. I don't know if the book has a trigger warning on it, but the audible version doesn't, and it really should.\n\nAnyway, thought you should make an informed decision.\n\nIf you don't struggle with eating disorders and choose to read it, enjoy it! It's a great book, and really interesting to see her incredible transformation from Little Hurting Jennette into Adult Healthy Jennette.\n\nEdit: I'm adding a paragraph, unedited, from a response I commented to someone below. I just felt like adding it because I feel it's appropriate to. (That last sentence sounded repetitive, but it's kind of not really lol.) Anyway, here it is, paragraph written by me:\n\n&gt;Yes, it's quite heartbreaking. My heart goes out to Little Jennette. I was going to add that into my last paragraph, but I was struggling with articulating it, and I know that saying that it's a great book is a compliment that an author would appreciate even if it's about their difficult life, so I decided to leave it at that.\n\nEdit 2: How do you create a double line break between paragraphs on the app? I tried looking online, but I can't find a proper answer that's working for me.\n\nEdit 3: Lol I just realized the first edit was actually unnecessary. I had forgotten that I actually didn't just leave it at \"it's a great book\" in the end in the first draft. But it doesn't hurt to leave the edit in, so...there it is. :)\n\nEdit 4: Corrected the spelling of her name.",

Her character development was also pretty satisfying.\n\nI admire Fanny for her fortitude and ability to stand up for what she believes is right. Especially since she's also timid. I thought she was really courageous, and idk why most readers dislike her :(((\n\nElizabeth is probably the most beloved, and I think it's well-deserved if she is. Lizzy is witty, intelligent, and a total badass, what's not to love?\n \nBut I think my favorite is Anne Elliot - constant, strong, and gentle Anne. She's the oldest Austen heroine and I think she's also the wisest. She's awesome.\n\nHow about you guys?",

Her character development was also pretty satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admire Fanny for her fortitude and ability to stand up for what she believes is right. Especially since she&amp;#39;s also timid. I thought she was really courageous, and idk why most readers dislike her :(((&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth is probably the most beloved, and I think it&amp;#39;s well-deserved if she is. Lizzy is witty, intelligent, and a total badass, what&amp;#39;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think my favorite is Anne Elliot - constant, strong, and gentle Anne. She&amp;#39;s the oldest Austen heroine and I think she&amp;#39;s also the wisest. She&amp;#39;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about you guys?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It's a novelisation of a Gestapo case file from Berlin in the early 1940s. The main characters are an ordinary middle aged couple who learn that their conscripted son has been killed in the invasion of France. This news causes a moment of decision and they resolve to resist the regime. The book centers around them and their actions but also shows their neighbors and coworkers and the police officer who investigates their case and tries to catch them. The book is translated from German but the language is simple and precise with efficient characterization. It is very moving and the cat and mouse game between the policeman and the couple is compelling. This book has quickly and unexpectedly become one of my favorites. It is dark, but not despairing and I highly recommend it.",

A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many \"suggest some books\" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.\n\n* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n____\n\n**How to get the best recommendations**\n\nThe most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.\n\n____\n\nAll Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.\n\nIf this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.\n               \n- The Management",

A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many &amp;quot;suggest some books&amp;quot; threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let&amp;#39;s jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people&amp;#39;s requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get the best recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we&amp;#39;ve set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit &lt;a href=\"/r/suggestmeabook\"&gt;/r/suggestmeabook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I found it when looking for horror books recommendations, and it\u2019s plot seemed really unique. \n\nI just read 150 pages in -+ 30 minutes and could not put it down. Whenever I thought something was messed up it just became even more messed up. I\u2019m not finished yet but I\u2019m so hooked; I have to sleep for work tomorrow and trying not to read more. \n\nIm not gonna put spoilers in here (and would appreciate no spoilers either), but fans of horror should definitely give it a try. TLDR what I know so far is 2 women meet online and their relationship soon develops into something more. Though not very good; it involves manipulation, mental health, abuse, etc. Seeing them interact is so interesting. \n\nIm wondering if anyone else has read it and how you liked it? I love these kind of books that progress very quickly and instantly pull you in. For someone with no concentration it\u2019s perfect and so hard to put down!",

I never picked up reading again, and even when purchasing new books couldn\u2019t find the concentration to start reading it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then a book caught my eye, called \u2018Things have gotten worse since we last spoke\u2019 by Eric Larocca. I found it when looking for horror books recommendations, and it\u2019s plot seemed really unique. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just read 150 pages in -+ 30 minutes and could not put it down. Whenever I thought something was messed up it just became even more messed up. I\u2019m not finished yet but I\u2019m so hooked; I have to sleep for work tomorrow and trying not to read more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im not gonna put spoilers in here (and would appreciate no spoilers either), but fans of horror should definitely give it a try. TLDR what I know so far is 2 women meet online and their relationship soon develops into something more. Though not very good; it involves manipulation, mental health, abuse, etc. Seeing them interact is so interesting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im wondering if anyone else has read it and how you liked it? I love these kind of books that progress very quickly and instantly pull you in. For someone with no concentration it\u2019s perfect and so hard to put down!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I&amp;#39;m trying to force myself to at least finish the first part of the book because perhaps the actual story starts near the end of it or in the second part, but I am having trouble caring at this point. I&amp;#39;m ashamed lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How was your experience reading it for the first time? Did anyone not finish it? Should I keep chugging away even if it takes me years?

                    "selftext": "Holy god, this book was an absolute mess. Many aspects of this remind me of the third season of OUAT. Anyone who has seen it will be familiar with what I mean. Before I get into the story, let's talk about the writing. It's... very subpar. I'm sorry, but it is. There are many spelling errors, fragments, over-usage of single sentence paragraphs and unbelievably poorly written dialogue. I find it hard to believe this was edited at all.  \n\n\nSomething I want to point out before I discuss the plot. I understand this is a dark romance novel featuring a reverse harem. Yes, I read all the trigger warnings and whatnot. That being said. Choosing Peter Pan to center around your reverse harem erotica is strange. I think it's weird when *anyone* ages up a character who is traditionally a child JUST to write them having sex. The whole point of Peter Pan is that he's unwilling to grow up. Yet here, the author was like, okay but imagine Peter Pan but an adult, tatted, and he smokes cigarettes. And in doing so, it completely erased the character of Peter Pan. How did he grow up? She's changed his entire back story but has given us none of the details. What's the purpose of Neverland now? And there's also the case of our MC, Winnie. It is repeatedly mentioned that she has 'just turned 18'. Over and over again, we are told about how Peter takes the Darlings on their 18th birthday and that they are broken. The emphasis on the age is disturbing because it honestly reminds me of all of those ' FRESH adults JUST TURNED 18' pornos.   \n\n\nThe main character, Winnie Darling, has no personality aside from enjoying sex. All we know about her appearance is that she has brown hair and green eyes and she's malnourished. The only women in her life are prostitutes. One of which groomed her to use her body to get what she wanted from boys from a young age. She resents her mother for being crazy and a prostitute but then uses that as a defense for why she has unhealthy sex all the time.   \n\n\nSo the gist of the plot is this. Every woman in the Darling family gets taken by Peter Pan when they turn 18, and then he and his Lost Boys 'break them'. This means they get their mind broken into by a faerie who then drives them insane. It's purposely left as a mystery as to how she will get broken throughout the book, and it's a little odd mixed with Peter's 'no touching/fucking the Darling's'. It makes it seem like that's what was the cause of them being broken, yet later, Winnie fucks everyone with no consequence. So what was the point of this rule? First of all, why do only women get taken? Are men unable to retain their ancestor's memories? Secondly, if the Darlings are well aware of this 'curse' or whatever on their future daughters, why would they continue having children? Wouldn't you want to avoid that fate?   \n\n\nThe way sex is portrayed in this book is incredibly unrealistic and laughable. The Lost Boys are so sex-crazed that they pop boners at Winnie moaning because food tastes good. She eats a pancake, licks some syrup off her lip, and now Bash has a boner. There's even a part where Winnie is being taught to gut a fish, and she gets aroused by the mention of the dead fish's ANAL CAVITY??? I just...what?!  \n\n\nThe character of Vane(The Dark One) makes little sense to me. He is supposedly the worst one, the meanest one, etc. Yet he's the one who ends up saving Winnie in the end? It doesn't fall in line with his character at all. He spits in her mouth and constantly degrades her; at least, in my eyes, it didn't read as a consensual thing. Idk man; why is he suddenly bothered at the thought of Winnie losing her mind? Why does he care about her but not any of the other Darlings they did this to?   \n\n\nThe Lost Boys narrative bounces all over the place. They constantly talk about loving to break women and seeing them cry, bleed, beg, etc. But then, at the same time, they're constantly worrying over Winnie and how thin she is (this is honestly mentioned a ridiculous amount and this book is only 200 pages), hoping Vane isn't too mean to her, and worrying about her getting broken even though they constantly talk about how much they love to break women.... like what?!   \n\n\nIdk, this book gave me major ick vibes.",

It's one of my favorite romance novels to date.\n\nHe whips her a few times in the public square because she's committed a crime and when he stops, she demands he continues because she's sort of suicidal and has fully accepted her sentencing. I don't know, just the way Draven wrote it, I really liked it. It revealed the FMC's badass character without going over the top cringey like some other books do.\n\nAny other scenes touch you or make you remember it even a hundred books later?
