During the month of November, the sub book club will be reading **A Little Hatred** by Joe Abercrombie! Each week, there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Joe himself will be joining us for an AMA.\n\nFrom [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35606041-a-little-hatred) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):\n\n&gt;The chimneys of industry rise over Adua and the world seethes with new opportunities. But old scores run deep as ever.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the blood-soaked borders of Angland, Leo dan Brock struggles to win fame on the battlefield, and defeat the marauding armies of Stour Nightfall. He hopes for help from the crown. But King Jezal's son, the feckless Prince Orso, is a man who specializes in disappointments.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Savine dan Glokta - socialite, investor, and daughter of the most feared man in the Union - plans to claw her way to the top of the slag-heap of society by any means necessary. But the slums boil over with a rage that all the money in the world cannot control.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The age of the machine dawns, but the age of magic refuses to die. With the help of the mad hillwoman Isern-i-Phail, Rikke struggles to control the blessing, or the curse, of the Long Eye. Glimpsing the future is one thing, but with the guiding hand of the First of the Magi still pulling the strings, changing it will be quite another... \n\nYou may find the dates of, and links to, the discussion threads below in the sticky comment on this post.

She has struggled with all three of anorexia, binge eating, and bulimia, and she details her experience (including how she felt when doing it). Her book is great to spread awareness on what those with eating disorders go through, especially those who binge and purge, as she even writes about the toll it takes on her body. About her anorexia, she includes details about calorie intake and things like that. But of course, as with most good things, there are cons to it too. Although, if informed, a person who might get triggered could avoid the situation by not reading it. Someone actually wrote a post on r/bulimia to warn people that he relapsed from reading it. Another person commented that they too relapsed for the same reason. If the two of them did, I'm sure many many people around the world have. I don't know if the book has a trigger warning on it, but the audible version doesn't, and it really should.\n\nAnyway, thought you should make an informed decision.\n\nIf you don't struggle with eating disorders and choose to read it, enjoy it! It's a great book, and really interesting to see her incredible transformation from Little Hurting Jennette into Adult Healthy Jennette.\n\nEdit: I'm adding a paragraph, unedited, from a response I commented to someone below. I just felt like adding it because I feel it's appropriate to. (That last sentence sounded repetitive, but it's kind of not really lol.) Anyway, here it is, paragraph written by me:\n\n&gt;Yes, it's quite heartbreaking. My heart goes out to Little Jennette. I was going to add that into my last paragraph, but I was struggling with articulating it, and I know that saying that it's a great book is a compliment that an author would appreciate even if it's about their difficult life, so I decided to leave it at that.\n\nEdit 2: How do you create a double line break between paragraphs on the app? I tried looking online, but I can't find a proper answer that's working for me.\n\nEdit 3: Lol I just realized the first edit was actually unnecessary. I had forgotten that I actually didn't just leave it at \"it's a great book\" in the end in the first draft. But it doesn't hurt to leave the edit in, so...there it is. :)\n\nEdit 4: Corrected the spelling of her name.",

Sometimes I\u2019m so excited for an upcoming scene or event that I realize I\u2019m breezing through everything until then. Sometimes the language, especially with classic literature, seems so dense that I realize the last line has already left my mind and I missed the message of the paragraph. All in all, it makes me feel like I\u2019m not getting enough out of the books that many people consider masterful. \n\nI\u2019ve tried reading out loud, but find this frustratingly slow. I dislike audiobooks because I need something visual to focus on. I\u2019m not much into annotating. Any ideas for how to slow down and engage myself better in what I\u2019m reading?",

Sometimes I\u2019m so excited for an upcoming scene or event that I realize I\u2019m breezing through everything until then. Sometimes the language, especially with classic literature, seems so dense that I realize the last line has already left my mind and I missed the message of the paragraph. All in all, it makes me feel like I\u2019m not getting enough out of the books that many people consider masterful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve tried reading out loud, but find this frustratingly slow. I dislike audiobooks because I need something visual to focus on. I\u2019m not much into annotating.

Anderson's *Saga of Seven Suns* was an amazing epic, but when I first picked up the series, I read the summary to see what I was getting into. I was disappointed when I read the first book and realized that a big reveal at the end of the novel was given away by the summary. From then on, I didn't read the summaries, but after I finished the series, I noticed each book was consistent in that way.\n\nOn the flip side, I just started a book called *The Myriad* by R. M. Meluch. I am about 10% of the way through the book and all the information from the summary has been covered. The summary drew me in to the series, but now I'm hooked and don't know what to expect.\n\nSo, my question is: How much of the book can the summary spoil without ruining it for you?",

Anderson&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Saga of Seven Suns&lt;/em&gt; was an amazing epic, but when I first picked up the series, I read the summary to see what I was getting into. I was disappointed when I read the first book and realized that a big reveal at the end of the novel was given away by the summary. From then on, I didn&amp;#39;t read the summaries, but after I finished the series, I noticed each book was consistent in that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, I just started a book called &lt;em&gt;The Myriad&lt;/em&gt; by R. M. Meluch. I am about 10% of the way through the book and all the information from the summary has been covered. The summary drew me in to the series, but now I&amp;#39;m hooked and don&amp;#39;t know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my question is: How much of the book can the summary spoil without ruining it for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Hopefully you have all managed to pick up the book but if you haven't, you can still catch up and join in on a later discussion; however, this thread will be openly discussing up though (and including) **PART I: Biding Time, Wasting Time**.\n\nBelow are some questions to help start conversation; feel free to answer some or all of them, or just post about whatever your thoughts on the material.\n\n1. What are some of your favorite characters, parts or quotes? Which parts did you find confusing?\n2. What do you think are ways in which Abercrombie plays into fantasy tropes or archetypes and in what ways might he subvert them?\n3. How do you feel your understanding of events would change were the story told though fewer perspectives? Why tell the story in this manner and as an idea of factions or sides starts to form in your mind as a reader, do any points of view stand out as decidedly distinct from the others?\n4. What elements hint at forces other than might be found in a 'realistic medieval' setting? How do you envision these might come into play in the larger narrative?\n5. What other questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Which unanswered questions are the most interesting to you?\n6. BONUS: What would be a good artist or song to accompany the reading thus far?\n\nReminder that second discussion will be posted on Friday, November 11th and will cover up through and including PART II: The Man of Action.",

I find it ironic that this came out now, and in my head I\u2019m comparing the one fear/rumor spreader from the book -named \u201cThe Emergency\u201d- to mass media and high seated government that has been trying to push BS and lies that we find out as a public was BS way later on\u2026.

I find it ironic that this came out now, and in my head I\u2019m comparing the one fear/rumor spreader from the book -named \u201cThe Emergency\u201d- to mass media and high seated government that has been trying to push BS and lies that we find out as a public was BS way later on\u2026.

                    "selftext": "I first read City of Bones when I was fifteen and enjoyed it. Now coming back to it, I like it less, but it's still worth a read. I always classified these books as fantasy soap operas because everything is so damn dramatic. Here we have your typical plot of an 'ordinary' girl--don't worry, she's still pretty--who finds out she's part of an elite race of humans who fight demons. Obviously, she's slightly more special than the other super special humans, called Shadowhunters, but that part comes later.   \n\n\nCity of Bones is fun to read if you're not super nitpicky like I am. I noticed a ridiculous amount of grammatical errors throughout the book and a startling amount of inconsistencies.   \n\u2022 At the beginning of the book Clary reads a book about faeries, ghosts and demons, and when Luke asks her about it, she says it's her mother's. Later, when Hodge asks Clary if her mom ever educated her about folklore, she says that she hated all of that stuff and wouldn't even let her watch Disney. Um??  \n\u2022 We're told that witches are human beings who've taught themselves magic and that Warlocks are the offspring of demons and humans, therefore, have magic in their blood, but then later we're told human beings can't do magic at all.   \n\u2022 Clary is told she's the first mundane to step inside the institute in over a hundred years(later to learn she's not a mundane), and then later Simon is told he's the first mundane to EVER step inside the institute.   \n\n\nThe characters and world-building were the two things I focused on most in this book. For the most part, I found the world-building to be relatively well thought out and interesting. I thought the explanation of faeries being the offspring of angels and demons, werewolves and vampires being the results of demon curses, and warlocks being the offspring of demons and humans was well thought out. I think having warlocks be sterile because their crossbreeds is also an interesting concept to include. But it makes me wonder if werewolves can procreate. They're not cross-bred. They're humans with a disease. If they have a child with another human, will that child be a wolf? Or what if they have a kid with another wolf?   \n\n\nOne thing that infuriates me, though, is that the wolves' fur grows OVER their clothes. How is that even possible? How long is their fur? Also, when Alaric is half-phased, he has clawed feet at one point. Are you telling me his long toenails just burst through his shoes? If you try to tell me his shoes magically fix themselves when he turns back into a human, I will lose my damn mind. Also, Luke is a werewolf...and he wears glasses. Why? He says that the crossbow was his weapon of choice because he had excellent sight and aim, yet.....he wears GLASSES?!  \n\n\nThe self-insert of Clary Fray boggles my mind. It could not be more obvious. I know many authors fall into the trap of writing themselves into the MC but at least choose a name that's not so similar! Clare-Clary? Are you joking?   \n\n\nOkay, now focusing on characterization. I had a hard time liking many of the characters, in all honesty. Everyone was jealous of one another for some ridiculous reason. Jace is jealous of Simon because he was close to Clary. Simon was jealous of Jace because Clary liked him. Clary was jealous of Isabelle because Simon was paying attention to her even though she didn't even like Simon. Isabelle was jealous of Clary because she's tiny and pretty(and please, just let Isabelle be gay). Alec was jealous of Clary because Jace liked her. Like my god. They all need to get over themselves.   \n\n\nClary annoyed the absolute crap out of me 95% of the time. No one in this book knows how to talk to another human being normally. She's asking about everyone's personal life on the first day, like it's any of her business, wanting to know how Jace's dad died. So many of the characters seem to lack any social skills at all. There are so many unnecessary throwaway lines, but at the same time, they gave away some of the big reveals of the book for me. Those throwaway lines also made me believe that Clary is a whole idiot. There's a part where she mentions she's going to turn 16 on Sunday, and later on, Hodge tells the story of how Valentine killed himself and his child in a fire. When she learns that Valentine was married to her mother, if she had only had the idea to ask WHEN all this occurred, she might be able to intuit that Valentine is her father and that she had a brother. Like legit, all she had to do was say, 'yo, Hodge, when did the Uprising happen/my mom disappear?' '16 years ago, Clary, why?' 'oh noooooo, I think Valentine might be my dad.' And then the whole last chapter would be far less dramatic. It\u2019s infuriating that Clary is so nosy, but she never asks the right questions. She\u2019s too busy sniffing around Jace\u2019s sad orphan life and Alec\u2019s gayness to do some investigative work about her mother\u2019s past. If she had listened to Hodge and used her brain, she could have figured out that Valentine was her dad.  \n\n\nAlso like, they ignore what anyone tells them! Hodge *told them* Valentine's bones were found alongside a child's bones and backtracks when he 'hypothetically' talks about him having a son. Like, I see you, you lying sack of shit. Just because Clary doesn't pay attention to anything doesn't mean I don't.   \n\n\nClary's jealousy of Isabelle drives me insane. She feels violent anger towards her because she's tall, thin, and beautiful. And any time she flirts with Simon, she gets mad. YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE SIMON, CLARY. Like, relax.   \n\n\nIf there were one thing I would say to Clary, it would be to relax. She is so ready to jump down everyone's throats all the time. When she calls Luke a slimy Downworlder even though he's been basically her dad her whole life. Like she let herself get influenced far too easily.   \n\n\nI remember being excited that there was a gay character in this, but reading it now, I realize Alec is very much a trope. He's a self-hating gay hiding in the closet, in love with his straight best friend. He could not be more of a trope. I know he gets a happy ending and whatnot but just, ugh. I get tired of seeing these made-up fantasy worlds where everyone is still homophobic. Give me one fantasy world where they don't give a shit, please.   \n\n\nI'm not fond of Jace much, either. He's egotistical and not in a cute way. He puts Clary in danger by marking her; like I don't care if he suspected she was a Shadowhunter, he still could've potentially killed her if he was wrong. I'm still unclear if marking a human kills them, burns them or turns them into a Forsaken or does all three simultaneously, but Jace deserved that slap.   \n\n\nPoor friend-zone Simon is my favorite character, more than likely because Robert Sheehan played him in the film adaptation. I still think he and Clary should've just dated from the beginning, but she's an idiot and doesn't deserve his goofy vibes. I don't think Isabelle is a good fit for him either, \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af. I love that he saves the day with Abaddon in the end. Probably my favorite part of the book.   \n\n\nI like the concept of the seraph blades a lot but wouldn't naming them in the heat of battle be super inconvenient? Some Angels have super long names! Imagine you're fighting a big ole baddie, and you try to name your blade Macroprosopus, but it takes so long to say the word that you get killed. What happens if you call two different blades the same angel name? Can you run out of angel names? Will seraph blades become moot at some point? Also, are they legit just hilts, and a blade grows out of them? Or are they like glass blades that fill with heavenly light when named?  \n\n\nI'm also curious about the stele.

It's a weird flex to leave your readers with the knowledge that they were rooting for a brother and sister to be together lmao.

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first read City of Bones when I was fifteen and enjoyed it. Now coming back to it, I like it less, but it&amp;#39;s still worth a read. I always classified these books as fantasy soap operas because everything is so damn dramatic. Here we have your typical plot of an &amp;#39;ordinary&amp;#39; girl--don&amp;#39;t worry, she&amp;#39;s still pretty--who finds out she&amp;#39;s part of an elite race of humans who fight demons. Obviously, she&amp;#39;s slightly more special than the other super special humans, called Shadowhunters, but that part comes later.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;City of Bones is fun to read if you&amp;#39;re not super nitpicky like I am. I noticed a ridiculous amount of grammatical errors throughout the book and a startling amount of inconsistencies.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 At the beginning of the book Clary reads a book about faeries, ghosts and demons, and when Luke asks her about it, she says it&amp;#39;s her mother&amp;#39;s. Later, when Hodge asks Clary if her mom ever educated her about folklore, she says that she hated all of that stuff and wouldn&amp;#39;t even let her watch Disney. Um??&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 We&amp;#39;re told that witches are human beings who&amp;#39;ve taught themselves magic and that Warlocks are the offspring of demons and humans, therefore, have magic in their blood, but then later we&amp;#39;re told human beings can&amp;#39;t do magic at all.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 Clary is told she&amp;#39;s the first mundane to step inside the institute in over a hundred years(later to learn she&amp;#39;s not a mundane), and then later Simon is told he&amp;#39;s the first mundane to EVER step inside the institute.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The characters and world-building were the two things I focused on most in this book. For the most part, I found the world-building to be relatively well thought out and interesting. I thought the explanation of faeries being the offspring of angels and demons, werewolves and vampires being the results of demon curses, and warlocks being the offspring of demons and humans was well thought out. I think having warlocks be sterile because their crossbreeds is also an interesting concept to include. But it makes me wonder if werewolves can procreate. They&amp;#39;re not cross-bred. They&amp;#39;re humans with a disease. If they have a child with another human, will that child be a wolf? Or what if they have a kid with another wolf?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that infuriates me, though, is that the wolves&amp;#39; fur grows OVER their clothes. How is that even possible? How long is their fur? Also, when Alaric is half-phased, he has clawed feet at one point. Are you telling me his long toenails just burst through his shoes? If you try to tell me his shoes magically fix themselves when he turns back into a human, I will lose my damn mind. Also, Luke is a werewolf...and he wears glasses. Why? He says that the crossbow was his weapon of choice because he had excellent sight and aim, yet.....he wears GLASSES?!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The self-insert of Clary Fray boggles my mind. It could not be more obvious. I know many authors fall into the trap of writing themselves into the MC but at least choose a name that&amp;#39;s not so similar! Clare-Clary? Are you joking?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, now focusing on characterization. I had a hard time liking many of the characters, in all honesty. Everyone was jealous of one another for some ridiculous reason. Jace is jealous of Simon because he was close to Clary. Simon was jealous of Jace because Clary liked him. Clary was jealous of Isabelle because Simon was paying attention to her even though she didn&amp;#39;t even like Simon. Isabelle was jealous of Clary because she&amp;#39;s tiny and pretty(and please, just let Isabelle be gay). Alec was jealous of Clary because Jace liked her. Like my god. They all need to get over themselves.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clary annoyed the absolute crap out of me 95% of the time. No one in this book knows how to talk to another human being normally. She&amp;#39;s asking about everyone&amp;#39;s personal life on the first day, like it&amp;#39;s any of her business, wanting to know how Jace&amp;#39;s dad died. So many of the characters seem to lack any social skills at all. There are so many unnecessary throwaway lines, but at the same time, they gave away some of the big reveals of the book for me. Those throwaway lines also made me believe that Clary is a whole idiot. There&amp;#39;s a part where she mentions she&amp;#39;s going to turn 16 on Sunday, and later on, Hodge tells the story of how Valentine killed himself and his child in a fire. When she learns that Valentine was married to her mother, if she had only had the idea to ask WHEN all this occurred, she might be able to intuit that Valentine is her father and that she had a brother. Like legit, all she had to do was say, &amp;#39;yo, Hodge, when did the Uprising happen/my mom disappear?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;16 years ago, Clary, why?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;oh noooooo, I think Valentine might be my dad.&amp;#39; And then the whole last chapter would be far less dramatic. It\u2019s infuriating that Clary is so nosy, but she never asks the right questions. She\u2019s too busy sniffing around Jace\u2019s sad orphan life and Alec\u2019s gayness to do some investigative work about her mother\u2019s past. If she had listened to Hodge and used her brain, she could have figured out that Valentine was her dad.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also like, they ignore what anyone tells them! Hodge &lt;em&gt;told them&lt;/em&gt; Valentine&amp;#39;s bones were found alongside a child&amp;#39;s bones and backtracks when he &amp;#39;hypothetically&amp;#39; talks about him having a son. Like, I see you, you lying sack of shit. Just because Clary doesn&amp;#39;t pay attention to anything doesn&amp;#39;t mean I don&amp;#39;t.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clary&amp;#39;s jealousy of Isabelle drives me insane. She feels violent anger towards her because she&amp;#39;s tall, thin, and beautiful. And any time she flirts with Simon, she gets mad. YOU DON&amp;#39;T EVEN LIKE SIMON, CLARY. Like, relax.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there were one thing I would say to Clary, it would be to relax. She is so ready to jump down everyone&amp;#39;s throats all the time. When she calls Luke a slimy Downworlder even though he&amp;#39;s been basically her dad her whole life. Like she let herself get influenced far too easily.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember being excited that there was a gay character in this, but reading it now, I realize Alec is very much a trope. He&amp;#39;s a self-hating gay hiding in the closet, in love with his straight best friend. He could not be more of a trope. I know he gets a happy ending and whatnot but just, ugh. I get tired of seeing these made-up fantasy worlds where everyone is still homophobic. Give me one fantasy world where they don&amp;#39;t give a shit, please.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not fond of Jace much, either. He&amp;#39;s egotistical and not in a cute way. He puts Clary in danger by marking her; like I don&amp;#39;t care if he suspected she was a Shadowhunter, he still could&amp;#39;ve potentially killed her if he was wrong. I&amp;#39;m still unclear if marking a human kills them, burns them or turns them into a Forsaken or does all three simultaneously, but Jace deserved that slap.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor friend-zone Simon is my favorite character, more than likely because Robert Sheehan played him in the film adaptation. I still think he and Clary should&amp;#39;ve just dated from the beginning, but she&amp;#39;s an idiot and doesn&amp;#39;t deserve his goofy vibes. I don&amp;#39;t think Isabelle is a good fit for him either, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. I love that he saves the day with Abaddon in the end. Probably my favorite part of the book.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the concept of the seraph blades a lot but wouldn&amp;#39;t naming them in the heat of battle be super inconvenient? Some Angels have super long names! Imagine you&amp;#39;re fighting a big ole baddie, and you try to name your blade Macroprosopus, but it takes so long to say the word that you get killed. What happens if you call two different blades the same angel name? Can you run out of angel names? Will seraph blades become moot at some point? Also, are they legit just hilts, and a blade grows out of them? Or are they like glass blades that fill with heavenly light when named?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also curious about the stele. It seems like it is sometimes a universal solvent and other times not. It can heal a broken arm in two seconds but can&amp;#39;t cure Greater Demon poison. It can hold a door against pursuit but can&amp;#39;t unlock the same door? What exactly are its limits?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, how did Valentine manage to murder Michael Wayland and his son, drag their bodies over to the manor where Jocelyn&amp;#39;s parents were and burn them all alive to the point that Jocelyn was already able to see their charred bones by the time she arrived.

Despite such a slim page count, I feel as if I really know the characters, and having finished the book a few hours ago, I already think I\u2019m going to miss them. Elliott\u2019s quips, in particular, were a favorite of mine. \n\nI\u2019ve been aware of Maugham for a while now, but this is the first of his books I\u2019ve read. A few days ago I read one of his short stories, \u201cRain,\u201d and that was enough for me to be sure I had to pursue more. I understand Of Human Bondage usually gets the most plaudits, but knowing that, I think I might save it for a little bit, so that I don\u2019t knock out the very best right at the start of my experience with the author. I have a collected volume of his stories that I\u2019m going to work on as I decide which novel to tackle next.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite of Maugham\u2019s work, long or short?",

It\u2019s a short thing, and I wouldn\u2019t have taken two days to read it if not for work. But in the best of ways, it felt longer than it was. Despite such a slim page count, I feel as if I really know the characters, and having finished the book a few hours ago, I already think I\u2019m going to miss them. Elliott\u2019s quips, in particular, were a favorite of mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been aware of Maugham for a while now, but this is the first of his books I\u2019ve read. A few days ago I read one of his short stories, \u201cRain,\u201d and that was enough for me to be sure I had to pursue more. I understand Of Human Bondage usually gets the most plaudits, but knowing that, I think I might save it for a little bit, so that I don\u2019t knock out the very best right at the start of my experience with the author. I have a collected volume of his stories that I\u2019m going to work on as I decide which novel to tackle next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s your favorite of Maugham\u2019s work, long or short?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It's a novelisation of a Gestapo case file from Berlin in the early 1940s. The main characters are an ordinary middle aged couple who learn that their conscripted son has been killed in the invasion of France. This news causes a moment of decision and they resolve to resist the regime. The book centers around them and their actions but also shows their neighbors and coworkers and the police officer who investigates their case and tries to catch them. The book is translated from German but the language is simple and precise with efficient characterization. It is very moving and the cat and mouse game between the policeman and the couple is compelling. This book has quickly and unexpectedly become one of my favorites. It is dark, but not despairing and I highly recommend it.",

Because I do find it hilarious how all the characters ever seem to do is eat at one restaurant then almost immediately go eat at another. And they never seem to listen to each other at all, every character seems to just drunkenly ramble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s some sociopolitical context I\u2019m missing in this book?

Her character development was also pretty satisfying.\n\nI admire Fanny for her fortitude and ability to stand up for what she believes is right. Especially since she's also timid. I thought she was really courageous, and idk why most readers dislike her :(((\n\nElizabeth is probably the most beloved, and I think it's well-deserved if she is. Lizzy is witty, intelligent, and a total badass, what's not to love?\n \nBut I think my favorite is Anne Elliot - constant, strong, and gentle Anne. She's the oldest Austen heroine and I think she's also the wisest. She's awesome.\n\nHow about you guys?",

Her character development was also pretty satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admire Fanny for her fortitude and ability to stand up for what she believes is right. Especially since she&amp;#39;s also timid. I thought she was really courageous, and idk why most readers dislike her :(((&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth is probably the most beloved, and I think it&amp;#39;s well-deserved if she is. Lizzy is witty, intelligent, and a total badass, what&amp;#39;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think my favorite is Anne Elliot - constant, strong, and gentle Anne. She&amp;#39;s the oldest Austen heroine and I think she&amp;#39;s also the wisest. She&amp;#39;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about you guys?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Oh, they do all that in the MIDDLE OF A WAR. It's also inspired by Vietnamese culture.\n\nI found this novel on sale almost 50% off in my local bookstore and, despite it originally being published in 2019, just arrived in my country. I thought, \"Why not just buy this? You haven't read a novel in a long time and certainly not at this low a price.\"\n\nOnce I was on the first to fifth chapters, I was HOOKED. I read it as much as I could with the time I had and finished it in less than a week. 3-4 days at most probably.\n\nUnlike all the other books I've read (most of which were written by American writers), this is definitely the first book in which I found myself actually LOVING the characters and the world they're in. Maybe it's because I found it relatable since I'm from Southeast Asia.\n\nI will not specify which specific country I'm from, but all I can say is that the values about family, honor and respect (not to mention the RICE FIELDS lmao) from Vietnamese culture can be shared with my own. I guess that could be the reason why I often scratch my head at all the things I've read before in novels set in America or other western places because I couldn't \"get it\" for most of the time.\n\nTLDR: Please read it, especially if you're from SEA. It's short but very sweetly simple and I can proudly say it's now my favorite book.",

However, I just looked at my book shelf and saw a bunch of lice crawling on top of my books...\n\nFrom what I gather its partly dust collecting and humidity, so I put my dehumidifier in my room and cleaned the books, but I am wondering if there is anything else I can do. I cant freeze all the books unfortunately so is there any way I can get rid of them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: First of all thank you for all of your suggestions! Seeing the lice ruined my entire day and I did a bunch of article reading you guys linked and other stuff I kept googling, because I couldn't concentrate on work...\n\nA few of the solutions I've found are \"Book Lice Killer Kit for Home\" on amazon as well as \"Diatomaceous Earth\". I'm going to buy these and use them ASAP and fingers crossed for results. Currently I have my dehumidifier running at max speed in the room with all my book/paper stuff. And I've put out some lavender balls I had near the infested areas. And just did a general sweep/hoover of all the shelves &amp; books.\n\nIf that doesn't work I'm going to get some ice boxes and try to bundle freeze books using dry ice. As I only have enough space in my freezer for one book, and over 100 book collection...",

I killed it but soon after I saw another one... and another one... So I googled and found out they&amp;#39;re booklice, and figured out I can freeze the book to kill them and their eggs. However, I just looked at my book shelf and saw a bunch of lice crawling on top of my books...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I gather its partly dust collecting and humidity, so I put my dehumidifier in my room and cleaned the books, but I am wondering if there is anything else I can do. I cant freeze all the books unfortunately so is there any way I can get rid of them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: First of all thank you for all of your suggestions! Seeing the lice ruined my entire day and I did a bunch of article reading you guys linked and other stuff I kept googling, because I couldn&amp;#39;t concentrate on work...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few of the solutions I&amp;#39;ve found are &amp;quot;Book Lice Killer Kit for Home&amp;quot; on amazon as well as &amp;quot;Diatomaceous Earth&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m going to buy these and use them ASAP and fingers crossed for results. Currently I have my dehumidifier running at max speed in the room with all my book/paper stuff. And I&amp;#39;ve put out some lavender balls I had near the infested areas. And just did a general sweep/hoover of all the shelves &amp;amp; books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;#39;t work I&amp;#39;m going to get some ice boxes and try to bundle freeze books using dry ice. As I only have enough space in my freezer for one book, and over 100 book collection...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Holy god, this book was an absolute mess. Many aspects of this remind me of the third season of OUAT. Anyone who has seen it will be familiar with what I mean. Before I get into the story, let's talk about the writing. It's... very subpar. I'm sorry, but it is. There are many spelling errors, fragments, over-usage of single sentence paragraphs and unbelievably poorly written dialogue. I find it hard to believe this was edited at all.  \n\n\nSomething I want to point out before I discuss the plot. I understand this is a dark romance novel featuring a reverse harem. Yes, I read all the trigger warnings and whatnot. That being said. Choosing Peter Pan to center around your reverse harem erotica is strange. I think it's weird when *anyone* ages up a character who is traditionally a child JUST to write them having sex. The whole point of Peter Pan is that he's unwilling to grow up. Yet here, the author was like, okay but imagine Peter Pan but an adult, tatted, and he smokes cigarettes. And in doing so, it completely erased the character of Peter Pan. How did he grow up? She's changed his entire back story but has given us none of the details. What's the purpose of Neverland now? And there's also the case of our MC, Winnie. It is repeatedly mentioned that she has 'just turned 18'. Over and over again, we are told about how Peter takes the Darlings on their 18th birthday and that they are broken. The emphasis on the age is disturbing because it honestly reminds me of all of those ' FRESH adults JUST TURNED 18' pornos.   \n\n\nThe main character, Winnie Darling, has no personality aside from enjoying sex. All we know about her appearance is that she has brown hair and green eyes and she's malnourished. The only women in her life are prostitutes. One of which groomed her to use her body to get what she wanted from boys from a young age. She resents her mother for being crazy and a prostitute but then uses that as a defense for why she has unhealthy sex all the time.   \n\n\nSo the gist of the plot is this. Every woman in the Darling family gets taken by Peter Pan when they turn 18, and then he and his Lost Boys 'break them'. This means they get their mind broken into by a faerie who then drives them insane. It's purposely left as a mystery as to how she will get broken throughout the book, and it's a little odd mixed with Peter's 'no touching/fucking the Darling's'. It makes it seem like that's what was the cause of them being broken, yet later, Winnie fucks everyone with no consequence. So what was the point of this rule? First of all, why do only women get taken? Are men unable to retain their ancestor's memories? Secondly, if the Darlings are well aware of this 'curse' or whatever on their future daughters, why would they continue having children? Wouldn't you want to avoid that fate?   \n\n\nThe way sex is portrayed in this book is incredibly unrealistic and laughable. The Lost Boys are so sex-crazed that they pop boners at Winnie moaning because food tastes good. She eats a pancake, licks some syrup off her lip, and now Bash has a boner. There's even a part where Winnie is being taught to gut a fish, and she gets aroused by the mention of the dead fish's ANAL CAVITY??? I just...what?!  \n\n\nThe character of Vane(The Dark One) makes little sense to me. He is supposedly the worst one, the meanest one, etc. Yet he's the one who ends up saving Winnie in the end? It doesn't fall in line with his character at all. He spits in her mouth and constantly degrades her; at least, in my eyes, it didn't read as a consensual thing. Idk man; why is he suddenly bothered at the thought of Winnie losing her mind? Why does he care about her but not any of the other Darlings they did this to?   \n\n\nThe Lost Boys narrative bounces all over the place. They constantly talk about loving to break women and seeing them cry, bleed, beg, etc. But then, at the same time, they're constantly worrying over Winnie and how thin she is (this is honestly mentioned a ridiculous amount and this book is only 200 pages), hoping Vane isn't too mean to her, and worrying about her getting broken even though they constantly talk about how much they love to break women.... like what?!   \n\n\nIdk, this book gave me major ick vibes.",

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy god, this book was an absolute mess. Many aspects of this remind me of the third season of OUAT. Anyone who has seen it will be familiar with what I mean. Before I get into the story, let&amp;#39;s talk about the writing. It&amp;#39;s... very subpar. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but it is. There are many spelling errors, fragments, over-usage of single sentence paragraphs and unbelievably poorly written dialogue. I find it hard to believe this was edited at all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something I want to point out before I discuss the plot. I understand this is a dark romance novel featuring a reverse harem. Yes, I read all the trigger warnings and whatnot. That being said. Choosing Peter Pan to center around your reverse harem erotica is strange. I think it&amp;#39;s weird when &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; ages up a character who is traditionally a child JUST to write them having sex. The whole point of Peter Pan is that he&amp;#39;s unwilling to grow up. Yet here, the author was like, okay but imagine Peter Pan but an adult, tatted, and he smokes cigarettes. And in doing so, it completely erased the character of Peter Pan. How did he grow up? She&amp;#39;s changed his entire back story but has given us none of the details. What&amp;#39;s the purpose of Neverland now? And there&amp;#39;s also the case of our MC, Winnie. It is repeatedly mentioned that she has &amp;#39;just turned 18&amp;#39;. Over and over again, we are told about how Peter takes the Darlings on their 18th birthday and that they are broken. The emphasis on the age is disturbing because it honestly reminds me of all of those &amp;#39; FRESH adults JUST TURNED 18&amp;#39; pornos.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main character, Winnie Darling, has no personality aside from enjoying sex. All we know about her appearance is that she has brown hair and green eyes and she&amp;#39;s malnourished. The only women in her life are prostitutes. One of which groomed her to use her body to get what she wanted from boys from a young age. She resents her mother for being crazy and a prostitute but then uses that as a defense for why she has unhealthy sex all the time.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the gist of the plot is this. Every woman in the Darling family gets taken by Peter Pan when they turn 18, and then he and his Lost Boys &amp;#39;break them&amp;#39;. This means they get their mind broken into by a faerie who then drives them insane. It&amp;#39;s purposely left as a mystery as to how she will get broken throughout the book, and it&amp;#39;s a little odd mixed with Peter&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;no touching/fucking the Darling&amp;#39;s&amp;#39;. It makes it seem like that&amp;#39;s what was the cause of them being broken, yet later, Winnie fucks everyone with no consequence. So what was the point of this rule? First of all, why do only women get taken? Are men unable to retain their ancestor&amp;#39;s memories? Secondly, if the Darlings are well aware of this &amp;#39;curse&amp;#39; or whatever on their future daughters, why would they continue having children? Wouldn&amp;#39;t you want to avoid that fate?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way sex is portrayed in this book is incredibly unrealistic and laughable. The Lost Boys are so sex-crazed that they pop boners at Winnie moaning because food tastes good. She eats a pancake, licks some syrup off her lip, and now Bash has a boner. There&amp;#39;s even a part where Winnie is being taught to gut a fish, and she gets aroused by the mention of the dead fish&amp;#39;s ANAL CAVITY??? I just...what?!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The character of Vane(The Dark One) makes little sense to me. He is supposedly the worst one, the meanest one, etc. Yet he&amp;#39;s the one who ends up saving Winnie in the end? It doesn&amp;#39;t fall in line with his character at all. He spits in her mouth and constantly degrades her; at least, in my eyes, it didn&amp;#39;t read as a consensual thing. Idk man; why is he suddenly bothered at the thought of Winnie losing her mind? Why does he care about her but not any of the other Darlings they did this to?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Lost Boys narrative bounces all over the place. They constantly talk about loving to break women and seeing them cry, bleed, beg, etc. But then, at the same time, they&amp;#39;re constantly worrying over Winnie and how thin she is (this is honestly mentioned a ridiculous amount and this book is only 200 pages), hoping Vane isn&amp;#39;t too mean to her, and worrying about her getting broken even though they constantly talk about how much they love to break women.... like what?!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk, this book gave me major ick vibes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Major conflict, unlikely hero, and excellent online reviews were all hitting the right notes for me.\n\nThe author is a Harvard professor who focuses on work involving diplomacy, negotiation and conflict resolution.  He also advises important people on negotiations and governments on situations of armed conflict to bring them to a peaceful end.\n\nThe main character is also a professor, who advises governments on navigating their way through armed conflicts, negotiations, and such.\n\nIn the book, there is a major conflict, with time pressure and huge stakes.  The very important former students of the professor call upon him to help them navigate this.\n\nEvery step of the way, whether it's the president, a foreign government, a general, or anyone else, they never make a decision on their own.  The professor comes up with some logic in an anime-like moment of concentration, then everyone agrees to do what he says.  The entire world cooperates basically on his word the entire time, from Russia to North Korea to the USA.\n\nThen there's the touted \"romance.\"  I think there is one eligible female character in the book.  So of course, the obviously hot, smart, and funny professor gets the girl immediately.  And everyone bends over backwards to ensure, rather than her doing her job, they ensure the professor has plenty of time with her.  And of course, the other female character who is definitely ineligible to be romanced, manages to have some girl time gushing over the professor together with the woman he ends up with.  Definitely fails the Bechdel test.\n\nThe actual conflict resolution/main plot basically hinges on the enemies being both incredibly intelligent, but unfathomably stupid.  Basicaly boils down to \"The problem we've seen crop up time and time again, surely that won't ever happen again\" and the professor in a stroke of genius points out it can happen again.  Amazing logic, the entire world bows to him.\n\nOf course, that's not the only way the enemies are staggeringly stupid either, as they randomly overlook an obvious workaround to one of their plans.\n\nAt every point, the professor does the right thing.  He never falters, never shows any weakness, always has the right answer in time for it to matter.\n\nNow, if the book hadn't been written by someone with so many parallels, maybe this would be excusable.  But it felt like there was too much self-insertion going on, and I mean that in a couple ways.\n\nThe reviews were probably far higher than they should have been for this book.  Many of them mentioned being friends with the author, or having met him or studied under him.  These aren't people giving a 5 star review to some random person.  These are people voting for their friend.\n\nOverall, what could have been an interesting story ended up about the author's self-insert getting the one girl in the story, who exists solely for that purpose, with every side character being one-dimensional and serving only as a way for the main character to show off his amazing logic, and they all listen to him as clearly in politics everyone is perfectly reasonable.\n\nWould not recommend.",

                    "selftext": "With the [post on here about reading children's books as an adult](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yiwtq9/do_you_find_it_worth_reading_childrens_books_for/), I decided to pull out The Boxcar Children as it's the only book in the series that I enjoyed as an adult.\n\nAs a child, I always loved stories about children making their own secret place whether it was the boxcar in The Boxcar Children or the tree in My Side of the Mountain or the trailer headquarters with tunnel entrance in the junkyard of Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators.\n\nAs I thought about The Boxcar Children, I wondered how old it was. It was *old*. But how old? Twenties or forties I decided. Because it didn't seem like it was set in the Depression. And the fifties was too modern.\n\nI opened the book, looked at the date and it was 1942. But reading it, it still felt older than that. So I Googled.\n\nFirst, I was surprised to discover that the Boxcar series is still going strong today with almost 200 books in it.\n\nSecond, I found out that it was originally written in 1924. Then a revised, shorter version was put out in 1942.\n\nNaturally, I wanted to read the original book. Found it for sale. At $1600. I don't have that kind of money to spend on a book and wouldn't spend it on this book even if I did have it.\n\nThen I thought, \"1924. 1924. That's public domain.\" Went to gutenberg.org and [found it, complete with illustrations.](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42796/42796-h/42796-h.htm)\n\nRead it. And really liked it. The plot's the same, but the reading level is higher than the 1942 book. It's more detailed and more descriptive; some of the names have been changed. If you ever wondered (as I did) just what happened to the parents, the opening paragraph gives you a partial answer as well as a natural answer to explain the estrangement. It also explains the older children's caretaking abilities.\n\nThe book also gives flash forwards of the children's futures which were completely stripped out of the 1942 book.\n\nOne thing that was added to the 1942 book was funny to me. It's a concern about germs. In the 1924 book, the children drank water out of creeks. In the 1942 book, the children only drank water out of potable water sources. (That reminded me of an exchange of letters between Laura Ingalls Wilder, the author of the Little House books, and her daughter where Laura admits that her family drank creek water in Walnut Grove which she now knew to be ignorant so in the book she added a well.) In the 1924 book the children washed the plates, etc they'd found in the town dump in soap and cold water. In the 1942 book they used boiling water on the plates before they used them to eat. \n\nIf you loved the Boxcar Children, I highly recommend that you check out the original version. It's good reading and an interesting view into a different time. The male / female roles are so traditionally expressed with everyone staying in their lane.\n\nEDIT: Have to say I'm touched. I loved this book as a child. I had no idea how many people also loved this book from their childhood.",

That&amp;#39;s public domain.&amp;quot; Went to gutenberg.org and &lt;a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42796/42796-h/42796-h.htm\"&gt;found it, complete with illustrations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read it. And really liked it. The plot&amp;#39;s the same, but the reading level is higher than the 1942 book. It&amp;#39;s more detailed and more descriptive; some of the names have been changed. If you ever wondered (as I did) just what happened to the parents, the opening paragraph gives you a partial answer as well as a natural answer to explain the estrangement. It also explains the older children&amp;#39;s caretaking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The book also gives flash forwards of the children&amp;#39;s futures which were completely stripped out of the 1942 book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that was added to the 1942 book was funny to me. It&amp;#39;s a concern about germs. In the 1924 book, the children drank water out of creeks. In the 1942 book, the children only drank water out of potable water sources. (That reminded me of an exchange of letters between Laura Ingalls Wilder, the author of the Little House books, and her daughter where Laura admits that her family drank creek water in Walnut Grove which she now knew to be ignorant so in the book she added a well.) In the 1924 book the children washed the plates, etc they&amp;#39;d found in the town dump in soap and cold water. In the 1942 book they used boiling water on the plates before they used them to eat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you loved the Boxcar Children, I highly recommend that you check out the original version. It&amp;#39;s good reading and an interesting view into a different time. The male / female roles are so traditionally expressed with everyone staying in their lane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Have to say I&amp;#39;m touched. I loved this book as a child. I had no idea how many people also loved this book from their childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He's the eponymous Child of God, and he is a disturbing, violent, and deeply engrossing main character whose crimes steadily escalate throughout the course of the novella.\n\nLike everything McCarthy writes, the landscapes and scenes feel so real while somehow needing so few words to describe them. I could feel the wind from one relentlessly cold winter in my own bones, and the dust, dirt, and a general tone of disconnectedness and rural distance somehow suffuse every description of Severe County.\n\nIt has some of the incredible atmosphere of Blood Meridian, a taste of the sociopathy of No Country for Old Men, and is full of the incredibly tight, beautiful writing that animates all of McCarthy's books. Check it out if you haven't read any Cormac yet, or if you want a quick trip back into his world!",

I'm not a \"horror\" fan so I've generally stayed away from his books, but I do love dystopian and apocalyptic novels.  This is always on those \"must read\" lists in those genres, so I bought the book and read it slowly over two months (four kids and a full time job will do that to you!)\n\nMy initial reactions - the first 300 or so pages went FAST. I loved it. The tunnel scene with Larry Underwood was chilling and felt very real.  I could palpate the fear, I felt like I was going through it myself. Very possibly one of my favorite scenes in the whole book.  Also loved the scene with Harold crying mowing the lawn, because it felt realistic and human.\n\nThen we hit around 400-500 pages of DRAG.  It took me SO LONG to get through this part.  I pushed through, but it really took me like 6 weeks to get through these pages.  There were certainly good parts. I didn't hate any of it, honestly.  It just felt OK.  Mother Abigail and the scene with the weasels felt important.  The dinner with them all around the table, felt relieving.  But there was just something about journey, the travel... it felt too....something. Some of it felt pointless maybe?\n\nThen the last 300 pages or so was \"pretty good.\" I read it quicker, it felt like things were happening. But I wanted more of an ending.  More symbolism. More AHA.  The scene with Trashcan bringing the Abomb - he was FANTASTIC.  I enjoyed reading that part, the drama of the moment, of evil returning evil. But I wanted more from the main protagonists. I wanted Ralph and Glen and Larry to be MORE.  Glen, I actually liked his death. Maybe too short, but I liked that he died with no fear and truly taking a stand, reducing the dark man to nothing in his mind.  The other two I really wanted more from.  Their deaths felt listless and uninspired.  And traveling over the mountains with Stu felt overwritten.  And Frannies birth felt underwritten.\n\nOverall, I liked the book. It wasn't bad. I enjoyed reading Steven Kings style.  I certainly didn't hate it and was glad I read it...but it just was kind of OK for me.  There were missed opportunities for elaboration and other areas that were overkill.  I wish I could read the edited version and see how it came together. Maybe I'd love it more then.",

I thought some of you might enjoy it.\n\n\"I believe there\u2019s a web of creation, an invisible tapestry that would take us out of the realm of coincidence and more into the realm of pattern making or meaning making. Do I think there's some old dude in the sky who\u2019s directing traffic? I don't. But I do feel there\u2019s this profound way in which we sometimes recognize each other without knowing why. Sometimes are repelled by each other without knowing why. What\u2019s going on there? What happened before? What will happen after? \u00a0When we think of someone and then three minutes later the phone rings and it's them, and we haven't talked in three years. What's that? We never know who's going to cross our paths and change our lives.\"\n\n[https://open.substack.com/pub/janeratcliffe/p/dani-shapiro?r=1ffsf&amp;utm\\_campaign=post&amp;utm\\_medium=web](https://open.substack.com/pub/janeratcliffe/p/dani-shapiro?r=1ffsf&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web)",

What happened before? What will happen after? \u00a0When we think of someone and then three minutes later the phone rings and it&amp;#39;s them, and we haven&amp;#39;t talked in three years.

So it just happened that I woke up in the worst mood and experienced major writer's block. I did not want to go out for inspiration, so I thought it wise to read. But I didn't want to re-read the books I had in my collection and thought..... Why not search for something different? That's when I chanced on the Chinese novel translations. And man... were they significant? \r\n\r\nSince I didn't want to read just anything, I googled for the best they had and started with the Tale of Demon Gods; I must say that overall the book was a great read. The main character was fun and very lovable. The side characters had a charm you couldn't help but be drawn to, and the entire novel had an intricate system. My only misgiving was the chapters that made the plot repetitive after chapter 150. It was as if the author was trying to fill in the words. However, I'd call it a great read.\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing a harem novel, I searched for a novel related to what I'm writing-- the male leads one. That's when I chanced on NovelDragon. From what I saw, it seemed tailor-made for only male lead novels, which was just great!\r\n\r\nI went through the App and saw their highly-ranked novel, Peerless Taoist. I gather the title must speak a lot about it. Although it didn't start very well, like the Tale of Demons and Monsters from wuxia novels, the progress was spectacular. Suppose the writer of Tales of Gods and demons tried to fill the gap toward the end. In that case, the writer of Peerless Taoist was struggling to start, but once they got the hang of it, everything came together. Currently, I am at chapter 75 of Peerless Taoist, and I already like it more than my first read from wuxia world.\r\n\r\nNot to be biased, it might be that I didn't choose well, and I don't even know if Peerless Taoist will fail me in the end..... but I'm loving it so much now. Once I'm done with Peerless Taoist, I plan to look into the popular Bl translations...\r\n\r\nSo has any dived into the world of Chinese novel translations? What's your favorite website and your must-read novel there?",

So it just happened that I woke up in the worst mood and experienced major writer&amp;#39;s block. I did not want to go out for inspiration, so I thought it wise to read. But I didn&amp;#39;t want to re-read the books I had in my collection and thought..... Why not search for something different? That&amp;#39;s when I chanced on the Chinese novel translations. And man... were they significant? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;#39;t want to read just anything, I googled for the best they had and started with the Tale of Demon Gods; I must say that overall the book was a great read. The main character was fun and very lovable. The side characters had a charm you couldn&amp;#39;t help but be drawn to, and the entire novel had an intricate system. My only misgiving was the chapters that made the plot repetitive after chapter 150. It was as if the author was trying to fill in the words. However, I&amp;#39;d call it a great read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After experiencing a harem novel, I searched for a novel related to what I&amp;#39;m writing-- the male leads one. That&amp;#39;s when I chanced on NovelDragon. From what I saw, it seemed tailor-made for only male lead novels, which was just great!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went through the App and saw their highly-ranked novel, Peerless Taoist. I gather the title must speak a lot about it. Although it didn&amp;#39;t start very well, like the Tale of Demons and Monsters from wuxia novels, the progress was spectacular. Suppose the writer of Tales of Gods and demons tried to fill the gap toward the end. In that case, the writer of Peerless Taoist was struggling to start, but once they got the hang of it, everything came together. Currently, I am at chapter 75 of Peerless Taoist, and I already like it more than my first read from wuxia world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to be biased, it might be that I didn&amp;#39;t choose well, and I don&amp;#39;t even know if Peerless Taoist will fail me in the end..... but I&amp;#39;m loving it so much now. Once I&amp;#39;m done with Peerless Taoist, I plan to look into the popular Bl translations...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So has any dived into the world of Chinese novel translations? What&amp;#39;s your favorite website and your must-read novel there?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Honestly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s one of my new favorite books. Probably in my top five, I\u2019d say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It definitely wasn\u2019t boring. Although, I will say, it dragged a bit in Epilogue Part II, and I usually like philosophy. I\u2019m blaming it on the fact that I\u2019ve been up since like 4:30 this morning. Anyway, I highly recommend it to everyone. 4.5/5 only because I really didn\u2019t like the epilogue for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Hoping some other readers have some insight for me.\n\nI was an avid reader in childhood and my early teenage years, but post-graduation I kind of stopped reading altogether. At 32 years old I finally went back to my love of reading. The problem is that I very quickly racked up quite the bill purchasing a million books (and for most books, I will never read them more than once). My friend then gifted me one of her Kindle Fire devices so that I could check out E-books for free from the local library after I complained about my spending. \n\nMy issue is that I\u2019m having a hell of a time really getting INTO any book on the e-reader. I feel like my comprehension is diminished and I\u2019m struggling to connect with the characters (and oftentimes confusing myself on things like, \u201cwait, who is saying this? Who\u2019s that again?\u201d). Initially I thought maybe I just didn\u2019t care for what I was reading, but now I\u2019m about half a dozen books in and still feel the same way. \n\nI really want to love the e-reader because of the ease of taking it on the go (perfect for long vacations and all!) as well as the money it saves me, but I am just really struggling. Does anyone have any suggestions that may help? I realize I can still go to the physical library and check out books that way, but it\u2019s hard for me to get there (with time to look around) because my working hours and the library hours are not compatible. \n\nTL;DR - I am having trouble connecting with my books via e-reader but I really want to love it. Help!\n\nETA: Just want to say thank you to all the folks who just taught me there\u2019s a difference between an actual e-reader and a Fire because I didn\u2019t know!

                    "selftext": "The author chose the pen name Anastasia King because she claimed she wanted to honor a woman with the same name. The real Anastasia King was a mail-order bride strangled by one of her tenants whiles her husband pinned her down and then buried her in a shallow grave. All you have to do is google her name, and several [articles](https://victimsupportservices.org/memorial/anastasia-king/) about it will pop up. Now, explain how a dark romance with a woman who is repeatedly abused and sexually assaulted by men honors her--not to mention the number of times these men choke her. The author has changed her website biography several times\u2014I assume because she realized how tactless it was to profit off this woman\u2019s name. But rather than admit any fault in what she did, she continues to twist the narrative and lie about it. Now it says that Anastasia King sounds like a 'porn star's alias'...so that's unbelievably disrespectful.\n\n[Proof](https://scontent-ord5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/314373542_10158774180986161_1325937362826869159_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=s5fPYVXPmjIAX8-ZU2J&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.xx&amp;oh=00_AfBrElbo3H9k4MMCwvXWUSoOgBh61dafDxBSh8qp_ceLRw&amp;oe=6367338E)\n\n\\--\n\nThe last half of this book was an absolute struggle to get through. I wanted to give up repeatedly, but I have this problem where I have to complete any book I start, whether I like it or not. Reading Kings of Shadow and Stone was like running up a steep hill with exercise-induced asthma. Not easy. Classifying this as a \u2018dark romance where the villain gets the girl\u2019 is severely understating things. This is the story of a psychopath who kidnaps two women, enslaves one of them, strips the other entirely of power and breaks her hand. He curses her and her sister and has her sister whipped repeatedly so that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to do hard labor\u201d\u2026.??? He murders other women that he\u2019s coerced with like\u2026sex magic? It\u2019s weird, and there\u2019s a lot of gratuitous lesbian kissing for seemingly no reason. He\u2019s also killed children and pregnant women in his rise to power, so that\u2019s cute.   \n\n\nBy the end of the book, Keres has convinced herself that she\u2019s *changed* him and that they\u2019re in a real romantic relationship. The author claims to have a vast understanding of psychology, but while reading this book, it doesn\u2019t reflect. Nor does her supposed nursing degree. (Bone breaking free after 22 lashes? I thought she compared these books to Outlander. This is yet another example of how, when advertising one\u2019s book, one should compare it to things they have actually read. Legit, Jamie Fraser\u2019s back is a testament that bone would not break free from 22 lashes.)   \n\n\nKeres continued to be the most unlikable main character I\u2019ve ever read about. She is so weak-willed, I can\u2019t stand it. She can\u2019t stick to her guns about a single thing, and it\u2019s pathetic at this point. In the last book, we\u2019re told how not wearing shoes is one of her core values, but it took her two seconds to put on some shoes, and she doesn\u2019t even feel bad about it. Another of her \u201ccore values\u201d is that she doesn\u2019t eat \u2018animals of the earth\u2019, yet her elf tribe/clan hunt and kill animals to skin their pelts\u2026which makes no sense. It\u2019s so wasteful. It would make more sense to take every part of the animal, but they\u2019re just tossing the meat carcass in some ditch and letting it rot away. Anyway, Keres breaks her super important \u2018core code\u2019 to eat VEAL of all things. The most inhumane meat available. I\u2019m sick of hearing her whine and cry about everything and then doing it two seconds later like it wasn\u2019t a huge deal five seconds ago. \u201cOh wah, I have to marry Silas\u201d \\*marries Silas\\* \u201cI\u2019ll never ever cheat on my husband!!\u201d \\*cheats on her husband with Darius.\\* Like girl\u2026.can you stick to a single thing you say?   \n\n\nSpeaking of Silas and Darius, Keres has forgotten about them entirely since being kidnapped by King BERLIUM(barf). Like you would think, she had never spent the last book crying over which one of them she liked more. Now she\u2019s all about the man abusing her and her sister. Nice. And after Berlium has kidnapped Keres, he strips all her powers away, so she\u2019s basically entirely useless, which is hilarious as all hell to me. All along, Mrithyn, the death god who turned her into his servant, was guiding her arrows, so she has absolutely no skill of her own. She\u2019s been depending on someone else to do it for her this whole time. No wonder she never dropped her bow and arrow before.   \n\n\nThere continues to be minimal detail on scenery or anything pertinent to an actual plot. It\u2019s once more drunken info dumps about every historical fact the author has thought of. It\u2019s, unfortunately, incredibly dull, however. Honestly, I don\u2019t think I could tell you a single thing about this world\u2019s mechanics. I still don\u2019t know why all these Godling creatures adopt the same characteristics as one another. Why wouldn\u2019t they look like the god that they serve? Does every god in this pantheon have wings, fangs, claws, and horns?   \n\n\nI\u2019ll admit this is a weird thing to complain about, but it stuck out to me like a sore thumb. We are given hardly any sensory detail in this book. We\u2019re constantly told about the characters eating roast meat and veggies(which reminds me of ACOTAR so much because I feel like that\u2019s all they ate too, where are the fantasy foods??!!), and they drink all this wine and eat these unnamed pastries. Still, we\u2019re never told how anything tastes or smells. Except for the inside of Berlium\u2019s mouth, that is. It tastes like honey. It\u2019s hysterical to me that the author thought of all this tumultuous nonsensical history for her made-up fantasy world; she came up with all of these gods and did all of this supposed research on greek mythology. Still, she can\u2019t come up with a meal tastier than roast meat and veggies. We\u2019re never told what kind of trees are in this world or what kind of stone things are made out of. The weather is once again told solely through Keres\u2019 nipples. The anachronisms continue to pile up. (Cold tea, lace panties, button-down shirts???) The author even writes from the perspective of a blind person, and it reads like every other perspective.   \n\n\nOnce again, the POVs are not remotely consistent. Keres has a million chapters, and then there are random other POVS interspersed for seemingly no reason. Not a single character has a distinct voice that might make their narratives feel unique. None of them has any personality.   \n\n\nLike I said in my review of The Sunderlands, this is an excellent example of why having one\u2019s friends be your beta reader is a bad idea. Another writer would\u2019ve been able to point out all of these flaws. There were numerous typos, anachronistic phrasing belonging to modern-day instead of this medieval setting, unnecessary hyphenated words, words turned into proper nouns for no reason, SO MANY FRAGMENTS(I don't care what her team of editors say, it's not good writing), etc. There will be these serious conversations where someone is saying something profound and prophetic, and the response they get will be a \u2018whoa\u2019 or \u2018yeah\u2019 or \u2018yup\u2019, and I\u2019m\u2026what is happening here??  \n\n\nI find it very confusing trying to figure out the order of magic in this world. Are all elves gifted with elemental powers? I mentioned above how I want to know why all Godlings look the same and seem to have the same abilities. So why do Thane and Berlium also have these traits when they're not Godlings? Also, why isn't Berlium a bear? HUH? WHY ISN'T HE A BEAR SHAPESHIFTER? Why is he called The Grizzly King? Why do they call him grizzly bear? It makes NO SENSE. Why is a half-elf/half-fire daemon stronger than a full-blooded Ashan? Why is every character so uwu special? Nobody in this book ever earns their stripes, as it were, and if they did, we never got to see it.  \n\n\nNow regarding the love interest. I get it; okay, this is a dark romance. The main girl isn't a good person, and she falls for the bad guy. I get it. What I don't get is *why*. Because he apologized for breaking her hand? That means nothing. He'll probably break the other one sometime later. This book is a Stockholm syndrome scenario at best. I don't care that he didn't use magic on her to warp her mind. He can warp her mind without magic. Any man can do that. The thing about writing a dark romance between a villain and an anti-heroine is that you're supposed to make us root for them to be together. He is always cruel to her. Even in his moments of softness, even when he seems kind, there will always be the knowledge that he broke her hand so severely that the bone broke free.   \n\n\nI have to say that this book essentially followed the same skeleton as the previous book\u2014no straightforward plot. Two brothers are fighting over Keres, though, in this book, it's like four dudes. And then, at the end of the book, she's kidnapped by *another* dude(Geraltain, lmao) she'll probably bone at the end of the next book. Unoriginal, uncreative and boring book.   \n\n\nGeraltain is such a blatant rip-off of Geralt of Rivia that I can't handle it. He fights with two swords and is a renowned monster hunter with long white hair. Come on, girl. Do better.",

It\u2019s hysterical to me that the author thought of all this tumultuous nonsensical history for her made-up fantasy world; she came up with all of these gods and did all of this supposed research on greek mythology. Still, she can\u2019t come up with a meal tastier than roast meat and veggies. We\u2019re never told what kind of trees are in this world or what kind of stone things are made out of. The weather is once again told solely through Keres\u2019 nipples. The anachronisms continue to pile up. (Cold tea, lace panties, button-down shirts???) The author even writes from the perspective of a blind person, and it reads like every other perspective.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, the POVs are not remotely consistent. Keres has a million chapters, and then there are random other POVS interspersed for seemingly no reason. Not a single character has a distinct voice that might make their narratives feel unique. None of them has any personality.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said in my review of The Sunderlands, this is an excellent example of why having one\u2019s friends be your beta reader is a bad idea. Another writer would\u2019ve been able to point out all of these flaws. There were numerous typos, anachronistic phrasing belonging to modern-day instead of this medieval setting, unnecessary hyphenated words, words turned into proper nouns for no reason, SO MANY FRAGMENTS(I don&amp;#39;t care what her team of editors say, it&amp;#39;s not good writing), etc. There will be these serious conversations where someone is saying something profound and prophetic, and the response they get will be a \u2018whoa\u2019 or \u2018yeah\u2019 or \u2018yup\u2019, and I\u2019m\u2026what is happening here??  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it very confusing trying to figure out the order of magic in this world. Are all elves gifted with elemental powers? I mentioned above how I want to know why all Godlings look the same and seem to have the same abilities. So why do Thane and Berlium also have these traits when they&amp;#39;re not Godlings? Also, why isn&amp;#39;t Berlium a bear? HUH? WHY ISN&amp;#39;T HE A BEAR SHAPESHIFTER? Why is he called The Grizzly King? Why do they call him grizzly bear? It makes NO SENSE. Why is a half-elf/half-fire daemon stronger than a full-blooded Ashan? Why is every character so uwu special? Nobody in this book ever earns their stripes, as it were, and if they did, we never got to see it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now regarding the love interest. I get it; okay, this is a dark romance. The main girl isn&amp;#39;t a good person, and she falls for the bad guy. I get it. What I don&amp;#39;t get is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. Because he apologized for breaking her hand? That means nothing. He&amp;#39;ll probably break the other one sometime later. This book is a Stockholm syndrome scenario at best. I don&amp;#39;t care that he didn&amp;#39;t use magic on her to warp her mind. He can warp her mind without magic. Any man can do that. The thing about writing a dark romance between a villain and an anti-heroine is that you&amp;#39;re supposed to make us root for them to be together. He is always cruel to her. Even in his moments of softness, even when he seems kind, there will always be the knowledge that he broke her hand so severely that the bone broke free.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say that this book essentially followed the same skeleton as the previous book\u2014no straightforward plot. Two brothers are fighting over Keres, though, in this book, it&amp;#39;s like four dudes. And then, at the end of the book, she&amp;#39;s kidnapped by &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; dude(Geraltain, lmao) she&amp;#39;ll probably bone at the end of the next book. Unoriginal, uncreative and boring book.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Geraltain is such a blatant rip-off of Geralt of Rivia that I can&amp;#39;t handle it. He fights with two swords and is a renowned monster hunter with long white hair. Come on, girl. Do better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Not necessary the motherhood and being in a marriage, but having the feeling that you're stuck in life and you see no way of moving forwards. Everybody has had this feeling before so it was a good start to her story-line. Which is why I was happy that Clo would reach out to Ashling and look for a job just to have something that's only hers. And in my opinion this is the only part in her whole story that made sense and where she actually had some character development. \n\nMaking Clo realize that she didn't actually want a job but a glamorous lifestyle instead was a weird direction and this is where it all went downhill for me. When the affair started is where I lost all respect for Clo. Not because of the affair itself but how the author made her handle it. Clo basically couldn't care less about it or about how it made Dylan feel or even the kids. She just assumes that in some way or another Dylan will be there for her and give her the lifestyle that she's used to with him, even if she's living with another man. \n\nMaking Clo realize the horrible mistake she's made _after_ Marcus breaks up with her is a little cliche but it would've been a good opportunity for Clo to reflect on her life. Why did she like Marcus in the first place? Why did she feel the need to make Dylan find her? Why wasn't she putting in more effort to find likeminded people who know and understand what she's going through? What did she really want? We all know the answers to those questions and we can fill in the blanks ourselves, but I want to know what Clo thinks and what her reasoning is. Why couldn't she realize that all she had to do was be honest with Dylan, tell him how she felt, that he should start working less now that the business is successful and that she wants to work on their marriage but that she needs his support? \n\nIn the end Clo admits that she didn't respect Ashling as much as she should have but it's obvious that Clo _still_ doesn't as she's assuming that Ashling will be her friend again as long as she's sorry. Just like with Dylan, she assumes everything will be fine again. \n\nUltimately, I think that Clo's whole story-line was unnesecary and a waste of time. Clo didn't learn anything from her mistakes and her character didn't get the development that it desperately needed. We got it with Lisa, we got it with Ashling, we even got it with Jack and the other side characters but nothing with Clo. There was no depth, no development, no emotions, nothing. Just absolutely nothing. Clo's character was a missed opportunity that really had so much potential for a solid ending. We didn't even get a conclusion to Dylan's storyline other than that he couldn't handle the kids and gave them to Clo? Huh? That absolutely does not fit Dylan's character at _all_ so that was another disappointment.\n\nAll in all, I think I would have enjoyed Sushi for Beginners a lot more without Clo's storyline.",

                    "selftext": "I've recently finished reading my second Bond novel: Live and Let Die. I'd previously read Casino Royale rather enjoyed it, barring some frankly wretched misogyny. LaLD, on the other hand... (oh boy)\n\nThis book was just - in my humble opinion - racist, misogynistic shit. I genuinely cannot find a single redeeming quality for this abhorrent crap. At least the first novel had an engaging plot besides the grotesque views on women. But Live and Let Die? The plot is a snooze-fest, Bond is utterly incompetent, and my GOD the racism. According to one Goodreads user, the count of N-words and variations thereupon stands at 115. For reference, that works out to once every other page in my edition.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be so judgemental of the book. Yes, it's a product of its time, but I guess I just hoped for better from what is alledgedly one of the best spy series of all time.\n\nI'd be interested to here what you all think about the subject: is it worth continuing? Did others have similar qualms to myself?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor reference, I'm also including my Goodreads review below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Live and Let Die, written by Ian Fleming and  originally published in 1954, is the second novel in the James Bond  series. I actually rather enjoyed the first novel. It certainly didn't  age very well, but the central plot was enough to actually hold my  attention, so that was a plus. This book has both aged worse than Casino  Royale (much, much worse) but also has no such interesting plotline.  \nAs  Anne mentioned in her review, Casino Royale felt like a Batman: Year  One scenario, in which the protagonist made many mistakes in the course  of his origin, and that this would culminate in character growth and  greater competence going forward. There was no growth to speak of. Bond  is even less competent, in fact, sitting on his thumbs while the world  burns, and his own dear friend, Felix Leiter, gets fed to literal  sharks.   \nThe plot itself is just as disastorous as its leading man,  being a story of SMERSH trying to recover their finances via a scheme of  trading pirate gold, or some such bullshit. The plot of this novel  bored me to tears. Honestly, you'd think a story about the criminal  underworld being entangled with espionage would be intersting reading,  but even besides the rampant bigotry, it just wasn't. Fleming has an  obnoxious tendency to over-describe every minute detail in such a way  which simultaneously achieves nothing narratively, and draws attention  away from the actual story. To summarise, this book was a total slog to  read.  \nSMERSH run their operation through a gangster called Mr Big  (where the real problems begin). Big is a black man in a 50s era novel  written by a white man. Now, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what  went wrong here, but by God did it. This is, perhaps, the most racist  depiction of any black character I've personally read. In fact, it's not  just Big; every single black character in this book is written with  utter contempt from the author, and the white cast members (Bond in  particular). I could go on, but perhaps it is best to just cite a  passage from the text:  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"I don't think I've ever heard of a great  negro criminal before,\" said Bond. \"Chinamen, of course, the men behind  the opium trade. There've been some big time Japs, mostly in pearls and  drugs. Plenty of negroes mixed up in diamonds and gold in Africa, but  always in a small way. They don't seem to take to big business. Pretty  law-abiding chaps I should have thought except when they're drunk too  much.\"  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This class of racial profiling is rampant throughout the  book, with people constantly being judged on a basis of their  nationality (RACIST!), black characters having horribly caricatured  accents (RACIST!) and cultural appropriation which simultaneously  misunderstands said culture, while also insulting it incessantly (RACIS-  oh, I give up. Fleming just completely dropped the ball here.)   \nThere  were certainly signs of bigotry in Casino Royale, particularly in the  descriptions of women\\* (according to Bond, sex with Vesper had the,  \"sweet tang of rape\"), but this book took it to a whole new level. I was  dissapointed when Bond would halt the narrative for one of his  grotesque, anti-feminist rants, but it happened infrequently enough that  it didn't entirely ruin my experience. Live and Let Die, on the other  hand, is so packed with hatred for anyone not residing in the safe  territory of being a white male, that I simply cannot condone that  anyone pick this book up.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\* The misgynistic depiction of women is  less prevalent in this one, as there is generally less involvement with  female characters as a whole. However, one of the few times a female  character (Solitaire) does become relevant, she is treated as, \"a prize\"  for Bond; an object rather than a human being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I&amp;#39;d previously read Casino Royale rather enjoyed it, barring some frankly wretched misogyny. LaLD, on the other hand... (oh boy)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This book was just - in my humble opinion - racist, misogynistic shit. I genuinely cannot find a single redeeming quality for this abhorrent crap. At least the first novel had an engaging plot besides the grotesque views on women. But Live and Let Die? The plot is a snooze-fest, Bond is utterly incompetent, and my GOD the racism. According to one Goodreads user, the count of N-words and variations thereupon stands at 115. For reference, that works out to once every other page in my edition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t be so judgemental of the book. Yes, it&amp;#39;s a product of its time, but I guess I just hoped for better from what is alledgedly one of the best spy series of all time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be interested to here what you all think about the subject: is it worth continuing? Did others have similar qualms to myself?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference, I&amp;#39;m also including my Goodreads review below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Live and Let Die, written by Ian Fleming and  originally published in 1954, is the second novel in the James Bond  series. I actually rather enjoyed the first novel. It certainly didn&amp;#39;t  age very well, but the central plot was enough to actually hold my  attention, so that was a plus. This book has both aged worse than Casino  Royale (much, much worse) but also has no such interesting plotline.&lt;br/&gt;\nAs  Anne mentioned in her review, Casino Royale felt like a Batman: Year  One scenario, in which the protagonist made many mistakes in the course  of his origin, and that this would culminate in character growth and  greater competence going forward. There was no growth to speak of. Bond  is even less competent, in fact, sitting on his thumbs while the world  burns, and his own dear friend, Felix Leiter, gets fed to literal  sharks.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe plot itself is just as disastorous as its leading man,  being a story of SMERSH trying to recover their finances via a scheme of  trading pirate gold, or some such bullshit. The plot of this novel  bored me to tears. Honestly, you&amp;#39;d think a story about the criminal  underworld being entangled with espionage would be intersting reading,  but even besides the rampant bigotry, it just wasn&amp;#39;t. Fleming has an  obnoxious tendency to over-describe every minute detail in such a way  which simultaneously achieves nothing narratively, and draws attention  away from the actual story. To summarise, this book was a total slog to  read.&lt;br/&gt;\nSMERSH run their operation through a gangster called Mr Big  (where the real problems begin). Big is a black man in a 50s era novel  written by a white man. Now, it doesn&amp;#39;t take a genius to figure out what  went wrong here, but by God did it. This is, perhaps, the most racist  depiction of any black character I&amp;#39;ve personally read. In fact, it&amp;#39;s not  just Big; every single black character in this book is written with  utter contempt from the author, and the white cast members (Bond in  particular). I could go on, but perhaps it is best to just cite a  passage from the text:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever heard of a great  negro criminal before,&amp;quot; said Bond. &amp;quot;Chinamen, of course, the men behind  the opium trade. There&amp;#39;ve been some big time Japs, mostly in pearls and  drugs. Plenty of negroes mixed up in diamonds and gold in Africa, but  always in a small way. They don&amp;#39;t seem to take to big business. Pretty  law-abiding chaps I should have thought except when they&amp;#39;re drunk too  much.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This class of racial profiling is rampant throughout the  book, with people constantly being judged on a basis of their  nationality (RACIST!), black characters having horribly caricatured  accents (RACIST!) and cultural appropriation which simultaneously  misunderstands said culture, while also insulting it incessantly (RACIS-  oh, I give up. Fleming just completely dropped the ball here.)&lt;br/&gt;\nThere  were certainly signs of bigotry in Casino Royale, particularly in the  descriptions of women* (according to Bond, sex with Vesper had the,  &amp;quot;sweet tang of rape&amp;quot;), but this book took it to a whole new level. I was  dissapointed when Bond would halt the narrative for one of his  grotesque, anti-feminist rants, but it happened infrequently enough that  it didn&amp;#39;t entirely ruin my experience. Live and Let Die, on the other  hand, is so packed with hatred for anyone not residing in the safe  territory of being a white male, that I simply cannot condone that  anyone pick this book up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* The misgynistic depiction of women is  less prevalent in this one, as there is generally less involvement with  female characters as a whole. However, one of the few times a female  character (Solitaire) does become relevant, she is treated as, &amp;quot;a prize&amp;quot;  for Bond; an object rather than a human being. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Miller\u2019s way with words is unlike anything I\u2019ve read before, and I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t feel super smart and awesome reading this due to the language she uses. But what truly astounded me was how this book drew you into the perspective of a goddess in a believable yet foreign way, and as the book continues, you grow more comfortable and familiar with it, much like how Circe grows into her own throughout her many years of life on Aiaia. A couple months ago I also read Song of Achilles, and I had a much harder time connecting with that book than I did with Circe. While Patroclus was a character I could sympathize with, I couldn\u2019t really stand in his shoes completely, like a shoe that\u2019s a half size too big or a musical note that falls flat towards the end. And it was even harder for me to understand Achilles. But the note of Circe rung long and true for the entire duration of the book, and ended in a beautifully delicate yet powerful way with her becoming mortal. Seeing her encounters and relationships grow and shift and change was surprisingly easy; I\u2019m someone who easily grows attached to characters, but the fluid shift between each connection Circe makes with mortals makes it easier to let go, almost as if they were written in with a sort of distance to them to illustrate the slight disconnect between godhood and mortality. And this distance seems to constantly fluctuate too, like after she is raped she grows emotionally detached and bears no remorse for killing them or turning them to swine, but then is ripped from that detachment by Odysseus\u2019s charm. \n\nIt\u2019s such a stunning book from start to finish, and it\u2019s certainly one of my top book recommendations for others. (cough especially those who grew up with Percy Jackson cough)\n\nI\u2019d love to hear what other people have to say about it!

Now it\u2019s mainly about throwing in our faces how perfect Rhysand is. Rhys is the most perfect faerie ever in a land of misogynists. All the High Lords see their mate as property which is gross. And it\u2019s introduced that there has never been such a thing as a High Lady and all the Lords are against it. (What about Amarantha? She was a villain, but she was clearly in charge.) But then Rhys, being the most perfect man(male) ever, decides to make his mate Feyre a High Lady. \n\nWhich is entirely senseless of him. What did Feyre even do to earn the position of High Lady aside from marrying into it? She has no experience in politics at all. She just learned how to read LAST YEAR. But now, she has every power available and doesn\u2019t even DO anything with them. During the war, she pulls a Bella Swan, stands on a mountain, and watches the war. She sees it through other people\u2019s eyes, but the fight scenes are like \u2018he was a terror to behold and killed all the soldiers\u2019. Okay, but how did he kill them? I know SJM can write well-thought-out action scenes, as evidenced in ACOTAR, but why isn\u2019t that utilized here? It feels like SJM hates writing action scenes and would prefer to focus on her romances, which would be fine if it was with anyone but Rhysand. \n\nACOWAR gets the introduction of our first queer characters, and uh, I\u2019m not happy about it. Let\u2019s throw in a bisexual man purely to make him super aggressive about having threesomes with anyone he encounters. Or how about another bisexual who, in reality, is a self-hating lesbian who\u2019s purposefully leading Azriel on for no logical reason? Like\u2026this is not the type of queer representation anyone wants to see. \n\nAlso, why is Morr\u00edgan called The Morr\u00edgan when she\u2019s not really The Morr\u00edgan? For those of you unaware, The Morr\u00edgan is the Irish goddess of War, and she\u2019s also been associated with fate because she can foretell death, doom and victory. She can split her body into three and can turn into a crow. Morr\u00edgan in ACOWAR is\u2026blonde and has some truth power. It\u2019s bringing back memories of how SJM butchered The Ballad of Tam Lin. Now she\u2019s just doing it with The Morr\u00edgan. It\u2019s the same with how The Weaver is named Stryga, but she\u2019s not even a Strzyga. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a theme in these fantasy romance series where the author is afraid to kill people. Nobody dies in ACOWAR except for Feyre\u2019s father, and he doesn\u2019t even count because he hasn\u2019t been present for the last three books. He was brought in as a plot device to save the day at the last second and then get murdered in front of Nesta so she could have her whole PTSD arc in the next book. Every time you think someone might finally bite it, another person comes in to save the day conveniently. Cassian and Nesta are about to die, but Elain rescues them. Cassian is about to get killed, again, only for Nesta to save him. Everyone is about to get murdered, only for Amren to save them. Oh, the humans are here too, and Feyre\u2019s dad is leading the flotilla, and they\u2019re named after her!! Oh, Drakon and Miryam are here to save the day with that firebird/swan lake queen!!!\n\nAnd then Amren\u2019s sacrifice? Pointless. Rhys\u2019 sacrifice? Pointless. Like stop with the fake-outs and kill someone. \n\nI also would love to know why Feyre\u2019s body is constantly barking in pain. Also, the repetitive usage of \u2018gobbling up the atmosphere will stay with me for the rest of my days. Why does nothing have question marks??? \n\nI\u2019m done, goodbye",

Oh, the humans are here too, and Feyre\u2019s dad is leading the flotilla, and they\u2019re named after her!! Oh, Drakon and Miryam are here to save the day with that firebird/swan lake queen!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then Amren\u2019s sacrifice? Pointless. Rhys\u2019 sacrifice? Pointless. Like stop with the fake-outs and kill someone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also would love to know why Feyre\u2019s body is constantly barking in pain. Also, the repetitive usage of \u2018gobbling up the atmosphere will stay with me for the rest of my days. Why does nothing have question marks??? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m done, goodbye&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "The Night and its Moon should have been a good book. It had potential, but the author took so many wrong turns. Piper CJ apparently wrote this book in six days, got a lot of backlash for how poorly edited it was and then was gifted a second opportunity when Bloom picked her up to rework her novel and give it a brand new coat of paint, as it were. She had the chance to work with a professional editor and to take out everything in her book that was problematic and plagiarized. Did Piper take this chance and do all of these things? No. She did not. Rather than admit to plagiarizing and maybe apologizing for the (hopefully) unintentional racist stereotypes laden throughout this book and getting rid of them, she just added ten extra chapters instead.  \n\n\nNow, this is Piper\u2019s newly released version, this is the edition that should be relatively flawless, yet it\u2019s just\u2026more of the same. There is potential in Piper\u2019s writing ability, and I wish this book had gone through several more drafts before it was published. There are elements to the story that I like and that, if given the time to flesh it out, could\u2019ve been well done. For instance, I think the sensory details in the story are super vivid, but they, like everything else, are overdone. Regarding the writing style, Piper seems to be trying to adopt that lofty high fantasy language found in classic fantasy, but she falls short and instead comes off as super pretentious. Honestly, I feel like the whole book is so melodramatic. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to add as many descriptive words as possible and then redescribe the same thing in seven different ways. This book also suffers from a lot of telling and no showing. Or even sometimes, telling AND showing back to back.   \n\n\nSo TNAIM is about two \u2018special\u2019 girls, Nox and Amaris. One night, a visitor comes to Farleigh with a mysterious baby in his arms. He sells the baby to the \u2018orphanage\u2019, and Nox determines that she will protect this baby forever. It should be mentioned that while Farleigh is described as an orphanage/mill, it\u2019s a business that traffics children. Agnes sells children to be virginal brides or sex slaves\u2026.that is not what they do in orphanages\u2014just saying. So because this place works for the church, a bishop visits them once a month, and if he sees a faerie child, he\u2019ll take them off Agnes\u2019 hands without paying her. So Nox has to hide Amaris away, so he doesn\u2019t take her. Now here\u2019s my question. They say this place is an orphanage, and special children get bought fast, but only very young children have a good chance of getting bought. So why wasn\u2019t Nox adopted long ago? She\u2019s the only POC in Farleigh, and she\u2019s always put on display. Wouldn\u2019t someone have bought her by now? What about Amaris? It\u2019s insinuated that she\u2019s only hidden on the days when the bishop comes around, but again if she\u2019s so unusual and special, why didn\u2019t someone adopt her already? It seems like they were conveniently kept around until they were of an age to have sex so they could be sold to a brothel. Like\u2026ew? Also, it\u2019s an orphanage, but the head matron keeps the only girl of color as her serving girl\u2026..\\*whistles, explosion sound\\*  \n\n\nAnywho, Amaris and Nox both get into a fight with a bully who sexually assaulted Nox one time(a theme in this story). Then Amaris uses her magical whammy power on him, and he goes away forever and never returns. This scene serves two purposes. To show Amaris\u2019 power and for Nox to get whipped on behalf of the white girl. Nox has to hide Amaris and take the blame for the mess that was left behind in the wake of her fight, and the bishop is like, \u2018alright, whip her\u2019, and they do. No one stands up for Nox because they all know that she *has* to take the blame, or else they\u2019ll find the super special white girl. Also, the super special white girl does the easy chores because they don\u2019t want to \u2018mar her perfect skin\u2019, but it\u2019s okay to whip your dubious POC who is put on display all the time because marring her skin is fine???   \n\n\nIt\u2019s almost like Piper tries to undo what she did to Nox by having her back heal entirely, and there be no scars. But, like, girl, you still whipped your only POC (so far) to save your self-insert/plagiarized character.   \n\n\nSome years pass, and the girls are finally on auction for the market day because Agnes says they\u2019re selling children slower and slower, but she\u2019s unwilling to buy more children. First of all. You could\u2019ve sold Amaris and Nox earlier if you hadn\u2019t been hiding them from everyone, but okay. Second of all. It\u2019s an orphanage, is it not? Is purchasing children the only way Agnes can acquire them? Do parents not send their children there if they can\u2019t take care of them? If this place is funded by the church, orphans are left there constantly; why aren\u2019t they providing the mill with more children? Anywho, all the adults come, and nobody picks Amaris or Nox, which is weird, considering their specialness is consistently shoved in our faces. It\u2019s not until the brothel owner, Millicent, shows up to take two random girls that she notices Amaris and wants to acquire her. Nox naturally thinks this is the worst day of her life(let\u2019s not think about the day she was whipped, I guess?), and Amaris uses her magic power to not go with Millicent until she\u2019s had her period. Millicent makes Amaris, whom I believe is like 12 or 13 in this scene, get naked so she can be scoped for any imperfections. It\u2019s super uncomfortable and creepy. And what\u2019s even worse about it is that THIS is the catalyst that makes Nox realizes she\u2019s in love with Amaris. She states that she always believed their relationship to be \u2018a friendship\u2019 until a sudden intimate love springs out in her\u2026but nothing has happened to trigger this sudden confession *except* for the fact that Amaris was just stripped naked in front of her so she could later be sold to a brothel. Am I the only one who is seeing something very off about this? There\u2019s a line where Nox thinks that \u2018when Amaris needed her most, she had failed her\u2019 but like Nox\u2026girl\u2026you were *whipped* for her.   \n\n\nSo the girls decide they\u2019re going to run away together before Millicent can come to take Amaris. They start gathering knowledge and supplies, but we don\u2019t get to hear about any of them. Amaris gets her period, and it\u2019s the worst period ever because, apparently, none of the matrons bothered to teach these girls about their bodies, and now all of the girls think Amaris is dying. Anywho, Nox and Amaris are primed to run away, and an injured assassin with a gravelly voice shows up( I wonder who he could be!), ruining their plans to escape, so they have to delay. Nox confesses her love to Amaris, and Amaris, oblivious, is like, \u2018yeah same!\u2019   \n\n\nMillicent shows up early, and things go haywire Amaris ends up abandoning Nox to run off with the strange assassin who showed up the night before. She also mutilates herself in the process so she will no longer be \u2018perfect\u2019 and gives herself the exact same scar that Ciri has in The Witcher. How odd. Nox is left behind and has to go to the brothel in Amaris\u2019 place. How unsurprising that Nox gets shafted yet again.   \n\n\nSo while Amaris runs off with not Geralt of Rivia and his horse Cobb aka not Roach, Nox is forced to work in a brothel. Amaris trains to become a Reever and befriends the other Reevers and just generally has the time of her life, not thinking once about Nox save for a random wet dream and trying to bone her \u2018brothers\u2019 and in the meantime, Nox is miserable and lonely and depressed. Her thoughts are constantly revolving around Amaris; all she can think about is getting back to her. She\u2019s forced to have sex with men and is repulsed at their touch, and thinks about women the whole time. Oh, I forgot to mention that she\u2019s also a succubus and steals men\u2019s souls when she has sex with them. So so far, the only female POC character has been a trophy item to be put on display, a whipping girl for our special white main, and now an enslaved succubus.   \n\n\nThe whole second part of the story\u2014 \u2018Ownership\u2019 is a whole lot of exposition that I barely cared about. Amaris learns to become a Witcher/Reever but doesn\u2019t actually learn much of anything. She learns how to run and wield a sword, I guess? But doesn\u2019t learn how to ride a horse and doesn\u2019t actually get any real-world experience before she takes her vows. Amaris never learns to control her power when she had a full-blooded fae at her disposal who could\u2019ve potentially taught her. Like it just comes out randomly; there\u2019s no clear indicator when she is using her power. She could\u2019ve been using it the entire time she was training, and we never would\u2019ve known.  \n\n\nAmaris looks at her fellow Reevers as brothers but then tries to sleep with one of them? Emily compares her relationship with her younger sibling to Amaris and Nox\u2019s friendship, knowing that Nox is in love with Amaris and wonders why her relationship with her younger sibling was not the same\u2026???? This is about the part where I just gave up and realized this book was so pretentious I couldn\u2019t possibly read anymore.   \n\n\n**Plagiarism**   \nYes, this book plagiarized The Witcher. No, the entire book is not plagiarized, but Amaris\u2019 subplot *is*. Since Piper wants to keep doubling down with her motte-and-bailey fallacy that her book is nothing like The Witcher, allow me to point out all of the ways that it is.  \n\n\nSo, Amaris(Ciri) is half-fae with the whitest skin, hair, eyelashes and eyebrows you have ever seen. She has lavender eyes(like Daenerys Targaryen), a power that emerges when she\u2019s upset and screams(like Ciri), and she mutilates her face with a scar in the **exact** same position as Ciri\u2019s. Note that white-haired, scarred, action fantasy girl is not the issue here as Piper is trying to whittle it down to. If that was the *only* similarity, we would have no issue, and nobody would be saying anything.   \n\n\nBut, Amaris asks Odrin, a gravelly-voiced assassin, aka Reever to \u2018adopt\u2019 her and take her with him to his assassin home, which happens to be in a mountain fortress called Uaimh Reev full of other Reevers. There used to be more of them, but they died out through unknown causes. They fight monsters and work with any establishment that worships the All-Mother. Odrin also has a horse named Cobb(a name he gives to all of his animals). Samael, who has been at the Reev longest, is the one to decide whether or not Amaris gets to train even though the other Reevers don\u2019t want her there then they become her \u2018brothers\u2019.   \n\n\nNow. In the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia adopts Cirilla of Cintra through the Law of Surprise. He takes her to a mountainous fortress called Kaer Morhen, full of other Witchers. There used to be more of them, but they died out when humans attacked them. They fight monsters and work with temples that worship a mother goddess known as Melitele. Geralt also has a horse named Roach(a name he gives to all of his horses). Vesemir, who has been at Kaer Morhen the longest, decides if Ciri gets to train even though all the other Witchers aren\u2019t thrilled about it, but then they become her family.   \n\n\nShe even included the \u2018come on, roach/cobb\u2019 line\u2026  \n\n\nThe vows to become a Reever are remarkably similar to the vows to take the Black of the Night\u2019s Watch in Game of Thrones as well.",

She had the chance to work with a professional editor and to take out everything in her book that was problematic and plagiarized. Did Piper take this chance and do all of these things? No. She did not. Rather than admit to plagiarizing and maybe apologizing for the (hopefully) unintentional racist stereotypes laden throughout this book and getting rid of them, she just added ten extra chapters instead.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, this is Piper\u2019s newly released version, this is the edition that should be relatively flawless, yet it\u2019s just\u2026more of the same. There is potential in Piper\u2019s writing ability, and I wish this book had gone through several more drafts before it was published. There are elements to the story that I like and that, if given the time to flesh it out, could\u2019ve been well done. For instance, I think the sensory details in the story are super vivid, but they, like everything else, are overdone. Regarding the writing style, Piper seems to be trying to adopt that lofty high fantasy language found in classic fantasy, but she falls short and instead comes off as super pretentious. Honestly, I feel like the whole book is so melodramatic. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to add as many descriptive words as possible and then redescribe the same thing in seven different ways. This book also suffers from a lot of telling and no showing. Or even sometimes, telling AND showing back to back.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So TNAIM is about two \u2018special\u2019 girls, Nox and Amaris. One night, a visitor comes to Farleigh with a mysterious baby in his arms. He sells the baby to the \u2018orphanage\u2019, and Nox determines that she will protect this baby forever. It should be mentioned that while Farleigh is described as an orphanage/mill, it\u2019s a business that traffics children. Agnes sells children to be virginal brides or sex slaves\u2026.that is not what they do in orphanages\u2014just saying. So because this place works for the church, a bishop visits them once a month, and if he sees a faerie child, he\u2019ll take them off Agnes\u2019 hands without paying her. So Nox has to hide Amaris away, so he doesn\u2019t take her. Now here\u2019s my question. They say this place is an orphanage, and special children get bought fast, but only very young children have a good chance of getting bought. So why wasn\u2019t Nox adopted long ago? She\u2019s the only POC in Farleigh, and she\u2019s always put on display. Wouldn\u2019t someone have bought her by now? What about Amaris? It\u2019s insinuated that she\u2019s only hidden on the days when the bishop comes around, but again if she\u2019s so unusual and special, why didn\u2019t someone adopt her already? It seems like they were conveniently kept around until they were of an age to have sex so they could be sold to a brothel. Like\u2026ew? Also, it\u2019s an orphanage, but the head matron keeps the only girl of color as her serving girl\u2026..*whistles, explosion sound*  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anywho, Amaris and Nox both get into a fight with a bully who sexually assaulted Nox one time(a theme in this story). Then Amaris uses her magical whammy power on him, and he goes away forever and never returns. This scene serves two purposes. To show Amaris\u2019 power and for Nox to get whipped on behalf of the white girl. Nox has to hide Amaris and take the blame for the mess that was left behind in the wake of her fight, and the bishop is like, \u2018alright, whip her\u2019, and they do. No one stands up for Nox because they all know that she &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to take the blame, or else they\u2019ll find the super special white girl. Also, the super special white girl does the easy chores because they don\u2019t want to \u2018mar her perfect skin\u2019, but it\u2019s okay to whip your dubious POC who is put on display all the time because marring her skin is fine???   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s almost like Piper tries to undo what she did to Nox by having her back heal entirely, and there be no scars. But, like, girl, you still whipped your only POC (so far) to save your self-insert/plagiarized character.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some years pass, and the girls are finally on auction for the market day because Agnes says they\u2019re selling children slower and slower, but she\u2019s unwilling to buy more children. First of all. You could\u2019ve sold Amaris and Nox earlier if you hadn\u2019t been hiding them from everyone, but okay. Second of all. It\u2019s an orphanage, is it not? Is purchasing children the only way Agnes can acquire them? Do parents not send their children there if they can\u2019t take care of them? If this place is funded by the church, orphans are left there constantly; why aren\u2019t they providing the mill with more children? Anywho, all the adults come, and nobody picks Amaris or Nox, which is weird, considering their specialness is consistently shoved in our faces. It\u2019s not until the brothel owner, Millicent, shows up to take two random girls that she notices Amaris and wants to acquire her. Nox naturally thinks this is the worst day of her life(let\u2019s not think about the day she was whipped, I guess?), and Amaris uses her magic power to not go with Millicent until she\u2019s had her period. Millicent makes Amaris, whom I believe is like 12 or 13 in this scene, get naked so she can be scoped for any imperfections. It\u2019s super uncomfortable and creepy. And what\u2019s even worse about it is that THIS is the catalyst that makes Nox realizes she\u2019s in love with Amaris. She states that she always believed their relationship to be \u2018a friendship\u2019 until a sudden intimate love springs out in her\u2026but nothing has happened to trigger this sudden confession &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; for the fact that Amaris was just stripped naked in front of her so she could later be sold to a brothel. Am I the only one who is seeing something very off about this? There\u2019s a line where Nox thinks that \u2018when Amaris needed her most, she had failed her\u2019 but like Nox\u2026girl\u2026you were &lt;em&gt;whipped&lt;/em&gt; for her.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the girls decide they\u2019re going to run away together before Millicent can come to take Amaris. They start gathering knowledge and supplies, but we don\u2019t get to hear about any of them. Amaris gets her period, and it\u2019s the worst period ever because, apparently, none of the matrons bothered to teach these girls about their bodies, and now all of the girls think Amaris is dying. Anywho, Nox and Amaris are primed to run away, and an injured assassin with a gravelly voice shows up( I wonder who he could be!), ruining their plans to escape, so they have to delay. Nox confesses her love to Amaris, and Amaris, oblivious, is like, \u2018yeah same!\u2019   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Millicent shows up early, and things go haywire Amaris ends up abandoning Nox to run off with the strange assassin who showed up the night before. She also mutilates herself in the process so she will no longer be \u2018perfect\u2019 and gives herself the exact same scar that Ciri has in The Witcher. How odd. Nox is left behind and has to go to the brothel in Amaris\u2019 place. How unsurprising that Nox gets shafted yet again.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while Amaris runs off with not Geralt of Rivia and his horse Cobb aka not Roach, Nox is forced to work in a brothel. Amaris trains to become a Reever and befriends the other Reevers and just generally has the time of her life, not thinking once about Nox save for a random wet dream and trying to bone her \u2018brothers\u2019 and in the meantime, Nox is miserable and lonely and depressed. Her thoughts are constantly revolving around Amaris; all she can think about is getting back to her. She\u2019s forced to have sex with men and is repulsed at their touch, and thinks about women the whole time. Oh, I forgot to mention that she\u2019s also a succubus and steals men\u2019s souls when she has sex with them. So so far, the only female POC character has been a trophy item to be put on display, a whipping girl for our special white main, and now an enslaved succubus.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole second part of the story\u2014 \u2018Ownership\u2019 is a whole lot of exposition that I barely cared about. Amaris learns to become a Witcher/Reever but doesn\u2019t actually learn much of anything. She learns how to run and wield a sword, I guess? But doesn\u2019t learn how to ride a horse and doesn\u2019t actually get any real-world experience before she takes her vows. Amaris never learns to control her power when she had a full-blooded fae at her disposal who could\u2019ve potentially taught her. Like it just comes out randomly; there\u2019s no clear indicator when she is using her power. She could\u2019ve been using it the entire time she was training, and we never would\u2019ve known.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amaris looks at her fellow Reevers as brothers but then tries to sleep with one of them? Emily compares her relationship with her younger sibling to Amaris and Nox\u2019s friendship, knowing that Nox is in love with Amaris and wonders why her relationship with her younger sibling was not the same\u2026???? This is about the part where I just gave up and realized this book was so pretentious I couldn\u2019t possibly read anymore.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plagiarism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nYes, this book plagiarized The Witcher. No, the entire book is not plagiarized, but Amaris\u2019 subplot &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Since Piper wants to keep doubling down with her motte-and-bailey fallacy that her book is nothing like The Witcher, allow me to point out all of the ways that it is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Amaris(Ciri) is half-fae with the whitest skin, hair, eyelashes and eyebrows you have ever seen. She has lavender eyes(like Daenerys Targaryen), a power that emerges when she\u2019s upset and screams(like Ciri), and she mutilates her face with a scar in the &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt; same position as Ciri\u2019s. Note that white-haired, scarred, action fantasy girl is not the issue here as Piper is trying to whittle it down to. If that was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; similarity, we would have no issue, and nobody would be saying anything.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, Amaris asks Odrin, a gravelly-voiced assassin, aka Reever to \u2018adopt\u2019 her and take her with him to his assassin home, which happens to be in a mountain fortress called Uaimh Reev full of other Reevers. There used to be more of them, but they died out through unknown causes. They fight monsters and work with any establishment that worships the All-Mother. Odrin also has a horse named Cobb(a name he gives to all of his animals). Samael, who has been at the Reev longest, is the one to decide whether or not Amaris gets to train even though the other Reevers don\u2019t want her there then they become her \u2018brothers\u2019.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now. In the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia adopts Cirilla of Cintra through the Law of Surprise. He takes her to a mountainous fortress called Kaer Morhen, full of other Witchers. There used to be more of them, but they died out when humans attacked them. They fight monsters and work with temples that worship a mother goddess known as Melitele. Geralt also has a horse named Roach(a name he gives to all of his horses). Vesemir, who has been at Kaer Morhen the longest, decides if Ciri gets to train even though all the other Witchers aren\u2019t thrilled about it, but then they become her family.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even included the \u2018come on, roach/cobb\u2019 line\u2026  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vows to become a Reever are remarkably similar to the vows to take the Black of the Night\u2019s Watch in Game of Thrones as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This book looks like an editor has never even touched it though the author claims a \u2018team of editors\u2019 have gone over it dozens of times. I see no evidence of that. The book is overflowing with fragments; the author doesn\u2019t seem to understand how to use proper punctuation or even an Oxford comma. There are hyphenated words that should not be, and many typos and grammatical errors. There are so many anachronisms that I could probably write my own book about them. The author writes solely in fragments or overly purple prose, making the narrative difficult to follow. Words like \u2018Man\u2019, \u2018Human\u2019, and \u2018Sun\u2019 are turned into proper nouns for no conceivable reason. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Sunderlands is advertised as a \u2018villain origin story\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t feel like one. Keres is described as a bad guy from the beginning, yet she doesn\u2019t do anything I would consider villainous. This would have been better suited if she had begun the story when Keres died as a child and was resurrected. But clearly, the author was too excited to write her subpar smut, so she had to ensure Keres was at least 19. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the biggest struggles this book has is being far too ambitious. The author is trying to create her own pantheon from scratch, apparently based on Greek mythology, while simultaneously merging into a world of her own making that includes elves, humans and monsters. Faeries are considered mythical even though elves are technically a class of faerie. While, in theory, this could work, the execution is very poorly done, leaving a complete mess in its place. This book read like a half-baked cake taken out because the baker was too excited to frost it and show everyone how good of a job she did, but the flavor is TERRIBLE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as plot, I\u2019m still not entirely sure what it is. The chapters are mainly from Keres\u2019 perspective, but then there\u2019s a random POV from Liriene thrown in the middle and the epilogue is split between the two love interests in the book. I don\u2019t understand the point of the switching POVs if it\u2019s not going to be consistent. It felt strange and jarring to randomly be thrown into someone else\u2019s head when I\u2019ve grown so used to being in Keres\u2019. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeres\u2019 backstory is incredibly vague. She\u2019s chosen by a death god, resurrected for some reason, but it\u2019s never fully explained why. She\u2019s cursed with bloodlust, but it\u2019s unclear if she wants to drink blood or murder everyone. She\u2019s a vegan elf(with bloodlust?), claws, fangs, fire magic, a death curse, she cries blood and is somehow a wolf? And probably more to come. Listen, I don\u2019t mind your character having these characteristics but like\u2026at least make it make sense as to why!! All the powers are revealed randomly, so each time, I think, \u2018my god, ANOTHER power?\u2019 Oh, can\u2019t forget that time she heard a man\u2019s arm hairs raise. She also fights with a scythe and bow and arrow and has never lost a fight before or even dropped her bow before. No one has ever even cut her before ever in her life. Like my god, how Mary Sue can you be? Lmao. Her only physical features are \u2018opalescent white skin, white hair and green eyes.\u2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo other feature is mentioned, but no one can shut up about how hot Keres is. She only ever talks about blood, how she\u2019s Death\u2019s right hand, her obsession with blood, her nipples, blood and NOTHING else. I don\u2019t know if she hears this Death Spirit voice in her head or if she\u2019s just insane. She acts incredibly tough and full of resolve, but it\u2019s a mask. She whines and cries when told to do something but does it two seconds later anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, it\u2019s apparently impossible to write a medieval fantasy without copious amounts of misogyny. It\u2019s especially disappointing to see in a female author. All the women in Keres\u2019 elven clan are illiterate for some reason. But not Keres because she\u2019s \u201cspecial or whatever\u201d. &lt;\u2014I wish that wasn\u2019t worded exactly like this in the book, but it is. Every other sentence is \u2018female this\u2019 or \u2018female that\u2019. It really chaps my ass to see another woman calling women \u2018females\u2019 so often. \u2018Females are the lesser sex.\u2019 \u2018Females are illiterate.\u2019 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer elves are all vegan and don\u2019t \u2018eat animals of the earth (do they eat animals, not of the earth?) Despite not eating the animals, they still kill them for their pelts\u2026which makes absolutely no sense. What an absolute waste. Do they leave the corpses with the rotting meat in a ditch somewhere? Also, vegetarian elves in medieval settings make zero sense to me. How does that even work? Oh, and another thing. The elves don\u2019t wear shoes. Ever. Yet their feet are still soft as a baby and get cut up, which makes\u2026no\u2026sense. You will have calloused gross feet if you have been walking on the hard ground barefoot from day one. You are going to have essentially hobbit feet. Keres says these are all her core beliefs, yet she wears shoes with little to no convincing and feels no remorse. Keres is dead-set on not cheating on her husband but cheats on him immediately. So strong-willed Keres. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe arranged marriage plot was dropped about 70 pages into the book. Keres can\u2019t decide if she\u2019s happy about it or not. She didn\u2019t give a crap until she found out her mom wrote a will that said she HAD to marry him and then, like a child, started to get mad about it. She marries Silas anyway, who wants to trap her with the marriage because he didn\u2019t wish Keres to find out about his secret girlfriend at Court, and then when Keres runs off to Court(and finds out about his secret girlfriend), he\u2026doesn\u2019t even go after her? Or write or anything. Lmao, like what? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the world-building and background information is given in long rant-like info dumps.  The terrain/landscape is a mystery. The dynamics of the elven clan are a mystery. The distance between places is a mystery. The weather is described solely through Keres\u2019 nipples. Elves are all-powerful, have elemental magic, and can bond with gods, but I have no idea how these gods impact the world. Everything is thrown at us in drunken info-dumps instead of shown in an actual cohesive storytelling manner. But that\u2019s unsurprising since the author has admitted that she writes this stuff wine-drunk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe queer rep in this book is pathetic. The book starts immediately with a gay character dying. Two random side characters mentioned approximately three times are gay, so Keres can say she\u2019s not homophobic as she tries to murder one of them. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to kill him because he was gay. It\u2019s cuz he was human!\u201d But immediately after, as Keres\u2019 sister explains how she was in love with the woman who died at the beginning of the book, Keres legit says Liriene has a sick claim on Katrielle(the girl who died)\u2026.like, great queer rep there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe author claims there\u2019s POC rep in this book as well, and I\u2019m here to tell you that the first POC is introduced 300 pages into the book and is described as having \u2018skin like the earth\u2019\u2026.just, wow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for spice\u2026this book advertises itself like it is the spiciest thing you will ever read in your life. Well\u2026there\u2019s little foreplay, just instant penetration and lots of screaming and \u2018you like that\u2019 type of juvenile dirty talk. All the men go straight for choking. Like without warning, suddenly, a man is choking Keres. Like\u2026why?????? Why not write some sex that might actually FEEL good to the woman? No woman is going to get off from a man going down on them for .2 seconds and then slamming their dick in. Like, I don\u2019t know about you, but that hurts. Keres constantly talks about how she\u2019s an untouched virgin, and it\u2019s DISGUSTING. Someone compares her to a \u2018sheathed blade, shiny and new\u2019, and I literally gagged. You are writing a book for adult women. Please, for the love of god, write about adults. Most of us of sound mind do not fantasize about being untouched virgins or \u2018little girls who need to be broken\u2019. That\u2019s disgusting and, honestly, pedophilic. Most of us don\u2019t have mountain peaks for clits, either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe build-up between relationships is nonexistent. There is no tension. There is no chemistry. Just bland dialogue, and then suddenly, a man is groping Keres and biting her without her consent, and she does nothing to stop them. It just is like\u2026I guess this is fine  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s interested in either of the love interests. I\u2019m a person who tends always to find villains fascinating if they\u2019re written well, and like if they happen to be attractive and saucy, then that\u2019s cool too. But I don\u2019t find men who don\u2019t know boundaries hot at all. Darius kisses her without consent, threatens to break her back over his knee(????) and throws her into the river she died in as a child, knowing she can\u2019t swim. I\u2019m struggling to find why I should like either of these men. One of them she\u2019s whining about that she doesn\u2019t even want or like through the whole book until she\u2019s told she can\u2019t have him, then she\u2019s terrified of losing him??? You make no sense, gurl. Someone explain to me what\u2019s sexy about a man threatening to paralyze you lmao; I don\u2019t understand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will end this review by begging the author to get an editor. Stop lying about it because all I have to do is read your book once to know that no editor went over this. Get someone who will be brutally honest with you because then you might be able to make your book into something resembling what you advertise it to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, one last thing. It\u2019s strange to advertise your book as being like \u2018The Witcher, Game of Thrones and Outlander\u2019 when you haven\u2019t even read those books. The author has admitted they have never even read The Witcher series, so like\u2026how do you know if your book is like that???",

This would have been better suited if she had begun the story when Keres died as a child and was resurrected. But clearly, the author was too excited to write her subpar smut, so she had to ensure Keres was at least 19. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles this book has is being far too ambitious. The author is trying to create her own pantheon from scratch, apparently based on Greek mythology, while simultaneously merging into a world of her own making that includes elves, humans and monsters. Faeries are considered mythical even though elves are technically a class of faerie. While, in theory, this could work, the execution is very poorly done, leaving a complete mess in its place. This book read like a half-baked cake taken out because the baker was too excited to frost it and show everyone how good of a job she did, but the flavor is TERRIBLE. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as plot, I\u2019m still not entirely sure what it is. The chapters are mainly from Keres\u2019 perspective, but then there\u2019s a random POV from Liriene thrown in the middle and the epilogue is split between the two love interests in the book. I don\u2019t understand the point of the switching POVs if it\u2019s not going to be consistent. It felt strange and jarring to randomly be thrown into someone else\u2019s head when I\u2019ve grown so used to being in Keres\u2019. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keres\u2019 backstory is incredibly vague. She\u2019s chosen by a death god, resurrected for some reason, but it\u2019s never fully explained why. She\u2019s cursed with bloodlust, but it\u2019s unclear if she wants to drink blood or murder everyone. She\u2019s a vegan elf(with bloodlust?), claws, fangs, fire magic, a death curse, she cries blood and is somehow a wolf? And probably more to come. Listen, I don\u2019t mind your character having these characteristics but like\u2026at least make it make sense as to why!! All the powers are revealed randomly, so each time, I think, \u2018my god, ANOTHER power?\u2019 Oh, can\u2019t forget that time she heard a man\u2019s arm hairs raise. She also fights with a scythe and bow and arrow and has never lost a fight before or even dropped her bow before. No one has ever even cut her before ever in her life. Like my god, how Mary Sue can you be? Lmao. Her only physical features are \u2018opalescent white skin, white hair and green eyes.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No other feature is mentioned, but no one can shut up about how hot Keres is. She only ever talks about blood, how she\u2019s Death\u2019s right hand, her obsession with blood, her nipples, blood and NOTHING else. I don\u2019t know if she hears this Death Spirit voice in her head or if she\u2019s just insane. She acts incredibly tough and full of resolve, but it\u2019s a mask. She whines and cries when told to do something but does it two seconds later anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it\u2019s apparently impossible to write a medieval fantasy without copious amounts of misogyny. It\u2019s especially disappointing to see in a female author. All the women in Keres\u2019 elven clan are illiterate for some reason. But not Keres because she\u2019s \u201cspecial or whatever\u201d. &amp;lt;\u2014I wish that wasn\u2019t worded exactly like this in the book, but it is. Every other sentence is \u2018female this\u2019 or \u2018female that\u2019. It really chaps my ass to see another woman calling women \u2018females\u2019 so often. \u2018Females are the lesser sex.\u2019 \u2018Females are illiterate.\u2019 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her elves are all vegan and don\u2019t \u2018eat animals of the earth (do they eat animals, not of the earth?) Despite not eating the animals, they still kill them for their pelts\u2026which makes absolutely no sense. What an absolute waste. Do they leave the corpses with the rotting meat in a ditch somewhere? Also, vegetarian elves in medieval settings make zero sense to me. How does that even work? Oh, and another thing. The elves don\u2019t wear shoes. Ever. Yet their feet are still soft as a baby and get cut up, which makes\u2026no\u2026sense. You will have calloused gross feet if you have been walking on the hard ground barefoot from day one. You are going to have essentially hobbit feet. Keres says these are all her core beliefs, yet she wears shoes with little to no convincing and feels no remorse. Keres is dead-set on not cheating on her husband but cheats on him immediately. So strong-willed Keres. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The arranged marriage plot was dropped about 70 pages into the book. Keres can\u2019t decide if she\u2019s happy about it or not. She didn\u2019t give a crap until she found out her mom wrote a will that said she HAD to marry him and then, like a child, started to get mad about it. She marries Silas anyway, who wants to trap her with the marriage because he didn\u2019t wish Keres to find out about his secret girlfriend at Court, and then when Keres runs off to Court(and finds out about his secret girlfriend), he\u2026doesn\u2019t even go after her? Or write or anything. Lmao, like what? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the world-building and background information is given in long rant-like info dumps.  The terrain/landscape is a mystery. The dynamics of the elven clan are a mystery. The distance between places is a mystery. The weather is described solely through Keres\u2019 nipples. Elves are all-powerful, have elemental magic, and can bond with gods, but I have no idea how these gods impact the world. Everything is thrown at us in drunken info-dumps instead of shown in an actual cohesive storytelling manner. But that\u2019s unsurprising since the author has admitted that she writes this stuff wine-drunk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The queer rep in this book is pathetic. The book starts immediately with a gay character dying. Two random side characters mentioned approximately three times are gay, so Keres can say she\u2019s not homophobic as she tries to murder one of them. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to kill him because he was gay. It\u2019s cuz he was human!\u201d But immediately after, as Keres\u2019 sister explains how she was in love with the woman who died at the beginning of the book, Keres legit says Liriene has a sick claim on Katrielle(the girl who died)\u2026.like, great queer rep there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The author claims there\u2019s POC rep in this book as well, and I\u2019m here to tell you that the first POC is introduced 300 pages into the book and is described as having \u2018skin like the earth\u2019\u2026.just, wow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for spice\u2026this book advertises itself like it is the spiciest thing you will ever read in your life. Well\u2026there\u2019s little foreplay, just instant penetration and lots of screaming and \u2018you like that\u2019 type of juvenile dirty talk. All the men go straight for choking. Like without warning, suddenly, a man is choking Keres. Like\u2026why?????? Why not write some sex that might actually FEEL good to the woman? No woman is going to get off from a man going down on them for .2 seconds and then slamming their dick in. Like, I don\u2019t know about you, but that hurts. Keres constantly talks about how she\u2019s an untouched virgin, and it\u2019s DISGUSTING. Someone compares her to a \u2018sheathed blade, shiny and new\u2019, and I literally gagged. You are writing a book for adult women. Please, for the love of god, write about adults. Most of us of sound mind do not fantasize about being untouched virgins or \u2018little girls who need to be broken\u2019. That\u2019s disgusting and, honestly, pedophilic. Most of us don\u2019t have mountain peaks for clits, either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The build-up between relationships is nonexistent. There is no tension. There is no chemistry. Just bland dialogue, and then suddenly, a man is groping Keres and biting her without her consent, and she does nothing to stop them. It just is like\u2026I guess this is fine  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s interested in either of the love interests. I\u2019m a person who tends always to find villains fascinating if they\u2019re written well, and like if they happen to be attractive and saucy, then that\u2019s cool too. But I don\u2019t find men who don\u2019t know boundaries hot at all. Darius kisses her without consent, threatens to break her back over his knee(????) and throws her into the river she died in as a child, knowing she can\u2019t swim. I\u2019m struggling to find why I should like either of these men. One of them she\u2019s whining about that she doesn\u2019t even want or like through the whole book until she\u2019s told she can\u2019t have him, then she\u2019s terrified of losing him??? You make no sense, gurl. Someone explain to me what\u2019s sexy about a man threatening to paralyze you lmao; I don\u2019t understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will end this review by begging the author to get an editor. Stop lying about it because all I have to do is read your book once to know that no editor went over this. Get someone who will be brutally honest with you because then you might be able to make your book into something resembling what you advertise it to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, one last thing. It\u2019s strange to advertise your book as being like \u2018The Witcher, Game of Thrones and Outlander\u2019 when you haven\u2019t even read those books. The author has admitted they have never even read The Witcher series, so like\u2026how do you know if your book is like that???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Even though they\u2019re middle grade series and I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve found myself greatly enjoying them, and seeing the lessons that they teach young readers in a fantastical way is interesting. I read middle grade as a child of course with Harry Potter and other series, and still read YA currently, but it surprises me that different age ranges can enjoy the same book, probably to the testament of the writer. What\u2019s a book or series that is outside of your intended or marketed age that you enjoyed?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
